stephens and mary kissel     welcome back to foreign edition of     a blockbuster     story     of mary on our front page from our wonderful washington based reporters jay solomon     and carol in the     u s senate cash to a ran as americans     were freed and when they see cash     they mean are they really can really mean cash palates of euros swiss francs     non us currencies     four hundred million dollars for a you know when you     have these ridiculous movies in someone opens a briefcase ec hundred our bills and it s a buzz represents the month of the sun     is really not that much lah imagine palate it is not counting on twitter by the way hashtag pallets of     pellets of cash and it happened to coincide     that way is the     finalizing of the u us     of the rainy nuclear deal with the     so called p five plus one     and it took place     not just in the week on the day     when for u s citizens     including washington post     reporter     most famously     jason resigned     were freed after months in a team in many cases longer years     of captivity     the administration is saying     this had nothing to do with the deal     this was not money for hostages     this was a down payment on     a pending settlement     at the un and the un tribunal     going back to a dispute     that the us has had with iran     in nineteen seventy nine     plausible explanation for the administration or not     it s not a plausible     explanation although the ministrations like you     to think that     i m all a lot of parts here bread salami sipri consent to sound a logical fashion     in nineteen seventy nine in disagreement was in for an arms deal     they didn t go through in iran challenge to     the deal was being litigated advocate     there was no reason for the u s government to settle mackay s think it s simply have have mitigated through and even if they had lost that case     there was a question of enforcement so     that system that system focused sideshow     the fact that that the payment have been on the scene gave the deal was signed     is a clear signal the fact that he was over it was a ransom     the fact that you re on its self called it a ransom     is another signal     in the wall street journal story ali al a third factor the fact that the rani negotiators one they d knowledge of the cash payment     before they signed the deal     because they wanted to show that as we reported to his gains something tangible from the united states     so put all that together if it looks like a ransom smells like a ransom iran is calling a ransom     it s a ransom     oh and this is one of things that drives me crazy the administration is that while the deeper they were two totally separate     things seventy one separate in the lines of the rain aeon s     and furthermore this is how you are and place this is how it has always     played     there are always demanding either political concessions more money in exchange for hostages they have been taking hostages     for years the top     of its of three american students hostages     in the in obama is     a first term     they took     that took some sailors of the royal navy sailors hostage     they took a big captured american sailors in legally     i just after that the of the deal was signed just for the sake of a propaganda coup     against     us     against the united states     maybe this is this goes back this is the m o going back all the way to nineteen seventy nine     and the scary thing is mary so     supposedly the ministrations and we got a great deal because     you know we could ve lost to the tune of ten billion dollars a figure the tunnel where they get there saying this good for u s taxpayers get is this is a great deal for u s taxpayers because were to lose the litigation in front of the tribunal s     i how they know that is a good question     aam and we were then and a boeing ten billion dollars to rent so we got off with one point seven billion dollars     so it s actually     not such a bad deal     so somehow the four hundred and twenty five million dollars for hostage is just a great deal and let s be clear there s more money to come because this is just the first installment of a one point seven billion dollar     payment     on a threat it s incredible that they are rationalizing any payment at all to a state sponsor of terrorism and either way     we should also talk about the way because peanut was named     in wyatt was made in that manner why did they involve the swiss and in dutch     in this subterfuge     why well because it s illegal under us sanctions     to transact with iran under us law u s banks cannot touch iran     so instead they can t pay iran dollars so instead they had to go in and list our allies     in get them     to pay ear on in in in cash pile     you know the other thing that i found incredibly striking about the     administration s     representations     is     the argument made by c i a director john brennan     then he knows     that this money is being used     for     to build infrastructure     he said he said     he said over the weekend in aspen or last week announced that     the money the revving of its client or anna s been used to support its currency to provide monies to the departments and agencies     build up its infrastructure     the     director brendan money is fungible that means if you re supporting     your infrastructure with some money     you ll be falling other monies to     hizballah in levanon to push on a side in the syria     to your goofy proxies in     the yen and i mean this is the essential problem with     the randy on the notion that you can give     the terrorists sponsor     money but you can say     it s all going to worthy causes like a building anew     um     you know carbon neutral energy system in ivanhoe and     as the hanukkah and let s be clear to secretary of state john kerry was questions about that very issue brett     just a couple months ago and even he even     said it i e you gotta give them a little credit for this he couldn t guarantee that the money would go to tear     the sun that is on the record     now     you just a couple weeks a couple of days ago ayatollah ali common name     um     lead you think donald trump knows the difference between the ayatollah khomeini and the ayatollah hominid known     that just     it just isn t     steven     m     covered returning said non trump programming from over here     i only common industry leader of the rand     now says that the obama ministrations us is not fulfilling     its and of the bargain action the administration has this report shows us     is using subterfuge and not telling the american people     all that it s doing in order to fulfill its end of the bargain     john kerry is going around     your up     trying to run the residents     to encourage european companies to do business in durand business they don t want to because they might run afoul     of a variety of u s sanctions never mind the business risks     of of     of being in town of being in     to rent     but this is this is what i find really     um     totally stunning so our economy says the americans are fulfilling their end of the deal     an lds won in recent weeks this is according to     solomon in these reports     in recent weeks the us for to them done     birinyi officials of them demanded that u s returned to billion in a rainy and funds     that were frozen in your into thousandnine     the supreme court recently ruled that the money should be given to victims of the rain aeon s sponsored terror attacks     this happens     as ever and has not taken     three american hostages that they can see i m not     the macie was an energy executives     at gm very     in favor of     detente with the ran his eighty year old father bacher     anis and eagle resident named     reza     cecchini     and i should add     you re and likely still hands     eyes are     on the c i a contractor robert levinson     has a hostage or perhaps knowledge of his whereabouts and he has been     held hostage who was held that the is hostage to his hostages began     all the way back     in two thousand and seven     nine years if you still live     in the rainy in captivity no word on his release     so the rain aeon s continued to make demands     continued to up the ante and you have an administration that shows     that we are prepared     in the long term to pay a heavy heavy ranson s     for the sake of appeasing     the mullahs and their on a piece of dough on a peaceable     appetite for american life     treasurer     and on     were to be back after this quick break     on

the sun nineteen states or announced by     the beest podcast listen ambitiously     from the opinion pages of wall street journal     this is     for in addition     now from our studios in new york     bret stephens and mary kissel     well welcome back to foreign edition and     we re now going to briefly become the jason gay podcast our friend jason sportswriter     are wonderful sports writer for the wall street journal one of the great     stylists in down in     the paper in the paper     is i know down in rio     the addition arrow     pumped up     for these olympics diseases upon the seas     because he s intact and again season and has an etsy neanda niv and the whole body seemed full body see all the time he should be     like walking in his jason of her walking your own     bubble like to live with negative pressure right so nothing can seep in     this is shaping up mary to be     a disaster zone of the olympics in a noble for sochi     couple years ago     before the athens olympics in two thousand and four     before the beijing olympics into thousandeight we remember the the year situation there the raucous predictions of doom     and that typically buick s began and are watching the     contest themselves     on tv you can get into it     i don t think that s happening this time of     day isn t happening in its issue right because you think of these athletes have devoted so much of their lives to getting to this moment     but look of the brazil gains were suppose to be a celebration of socialism the great socialist miracle of brazil     this country that had somehow like china and before it     has been found in economic development model that was pure magic     that was somehow better than our capitalist system     love them for the previous night hasn t stayed in brazil     course won the games in his successor     who came after him what what s on this as a way to     get the brazil on the the world stage finally they would always be a country in the future they d be a country of the present     but what we have discovered as we ve discovered in china is that this model does not work     it breeds corruption in its problems growth than in which inevitably pass this law was     a government takes over space that the private sector could have used it to innovate and grow     and frankly it s it s that debacle not just because the model doesn t work     on but because the brazilians have also been enough to wear this     a government that is i think in many respects bigger as a share of the economy     and france     what you think is is is just like the ultimate impossible right right so we have a situation     of an economy in shambles in recession     you rising crime rates the president was just a peach in and on top of that the security risks     that come from staging a global event like this just at the moment     when we ve seen the islamic state attacks     really increase in tempo in fatalities     you know um     i think in two thousand and nine     maybe getting might be off by a year or two but in two thousand i think     the economist magazine ran a cover     that was caught type of brazil takes often is a picture of the jesus overlooking rio s famous cheese this     sort of     taking off like it like it had rockets in its in its feet     and this was part of the     conventional wisdom of the first decade of the twenty first     century     you have a goldman sachs executive come up with a term rick     brazil russia india china or bricks if you add in south africa     as the great countries of the future     people were talking about the post american world in which these     other     centers of economic prosperity in the wool was     formerly been the developing a second or third world     were some the     economic powerhouses     brazil of course     aam     was the greater body met there s an old saying about brazil brazil s the country the future and always will be     but now you have this kind of brazilian mericle and it really fit the temper of the times because he said     do not     it is universal maybe not so that s of aam     was a social was the former radical labor leader would become kind of a social democrat     came to power saying that he was not going to reverse     the dramatic liberalization is of the nineteen     nineties under president cargoes of the of     brazil     but that he was going to spread the wealth more equally     and this sort of fit into the     sort of mood of people like barack obama and and     and the new left that this was a model i remember     interviewing a young greek politician     i mean lexus separates about     you know what his model was     and suppress them ahead of a bubble party costs means assembled my mom was brazil     mr said the     dow was the prime minister of     greece and the greek economy is not exactly thriving     but the brazilian model     of state led growth which was really just a repackaging     of the old third world model of     of     heavy handed government redistribution     of the support for state champion export led growth export led growth     led to the same problems     sclerotic economy is     on     a massive     corruption     has been a multibillion dollar     corruption scandal in brazil s     state owned oil firm     control of bras and when the commodity     boom     of the commodity cycle turns     the boom led to buy a house     dramatically negative growth rates of now you have     a plummeting economy bankrupt     a national     bank of national government     and     a caretaker president trying to pick up the pieces     while the impeachment of     this former president dilma another socialist it s radical     ex marxist guerrilla     moves through the on the resilience     of the brazilian legislature     sold all his friends is back to the olympics which it is and the point of this podcast is     don t have the olympics in third world countries     have them in first world countries     with highly developed infrastructures     don t try to turn the allin pics into     a national coming out parties     um and     opportunities for massive propaganda     trying to turn them into celebrations of athleticism     and last but not least     i m it s a pity this allin pics     did not pick up the entire russian team in     the tilting was unbelievable some very good reporting from our colleagues at the new york times     on this extraordinary scandal what they did in sochi     um there needs to be a price to be paid for     trying to destroy a     the spirit of the allin pics the with the russians did     it could ve sent a very useful message so i will not be watching the olympics     this summer and i will be i will not be i will be i want america to me and i want america to when i was sure athletes well     you know something     there are other fields for olympic for for athletic contest     doesn t have to be the olympics     i can watch something outs     one final topic baron before we call this podcast on that day     which is this incredible story     ok     jillian assigned to teach match against edward     snowden     julia signs of course the australian     war and founder of weeks and weeks     released mountains of data     going back     to the beginning of the obama administration     embarrassing     not only embarrassing and humiliating     administration officials     but also disclosing private conversations putting people at risk     he now     lives in asylum in the ecuadorean embassy in london     at the door of course is a populist     bordering borderline dictatorship began republic     and south america     it s become a banana republic use to be in this country unfortunate that that leadership     and he s taking refuge there because he s fighting extradition to sweden on rape charges that allege alleged rape charges     of     rape allegations know their charges of rape charges of rape charges of what the upgrade which have yet not     not as he is exactly because he has absconded to the ecuadorean embassy     um

american secrets also disclose them to     the world edward snowden out takes refuge     in that others in that     paragon of transparency and media freedom     putin s russia     and snowden is criticizing signage     for the week in week which embarrassed the democratic     convention     a couple of weeks ago     such fires back at all that still really wants is a pardon from the clinton ministrations     so he can     come back home for mom or russia     and all i can say is     i think these two guys does or     does it say it couldn t have happened to a nicer guy is great threat     well it snowed and probably in probably is looking for a pardon for whom the clinton     administration which is looking more likely by the day that i might add     and pardon or the administration
