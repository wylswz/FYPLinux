    bret stephens and mary kissel     me and any on him and he called on other notes from     the remaining outposts     or was     i ong and     so mary kissel     beloved stevens costs us slipped slightly in their home and the ruble and making going on in st     it also tetanus but new to do it for an addition on the onthe no     promises their work was based on that noaa guys sorry aren t sorry enough of that will stop their full stop     but donald trump is in my old stomping grounds monday     the city in which i was re living the city for which i integrated hiroki legally     that s true but i might sing     mexico city as we speak     it was sort of     the media s rats here are a married because i m     switching aladdin     um because     the donald     has just landed in mexico     at the invitation of     in the dipping and you told the them     i m now going to be really mexican and pronounce all     costs is the kid names the week on the murray and     maria ok maybe security backed use any of the i let s go with     um did just landed in mexico for a brief meeting with of the president of mexico     mr payne yet new poll     who had invited both candidates     to come to mexico city     this is something of a tradition i think john mccain in two thousand and eight     when to visit to the pick of their own     i     only one of the candidates took mr  been in utah on the invitation and that was     hellas donald trump he just arrived there we don t know what the outcome of the meeting is still some people be listening to this podcast after the meetings happened will know     more than we do and will instantly make fools of ourselves     it     we provide here     the look     and then as you know i m a pretty stern critic of     donald trump     missing is a political move     this was very smart on his part     it shows initiative the limelight is on him     if the doesn t     drool or or spit into issuu is going to come across as a statesman like a character who could deal     with international leaders on a     public stage     obviously he s doing so in the teeth for roche s opposition     he s been in a twitter war with the former president he sent the faux     the overwhelming opposition to trump setting foot     in mexico and soul     because the expectations are so low mary     all he has to do is exceed them slightly unique in the comes out looking looking like a winner well that s just it isn t in our our colleague james taranto interviewed the creator of dilbert scott adams     who has written about trump and     why it wrong continues to why tyc won the primary and why     scott and ceases to win the general election because     trump only has to exceed low expectations for is     hillary clinton has to prove she s trustworthy which is absolutely impossible     credit eyes on this news and it struck me how     this is the second time that donald trump has     outweighed hillary clinton and carter on the back foot with the trip because of course     he also went to louisiana with mike pence and handing out supplies     to the victim of um flooding     there     he also he was in britain and he was in britain yeh that s right make that make the time number three so     i think it it looks bad for the democrats to have trunk go there first i think it surprises people and a second and third lee     it shows that with trump on everything seems to be the negotiation     he said he has said some pretty offensive things about mexicans he certainly is an internal wars people read this semester s and so on or someone on twitter joe jokingly said we send mexico our worst people i was back at the end of his term     in my     i it s a smart move i think i m trumps part and who knows perak     if everything is negotiable with this guy maybe he ll even come around and change some of his positions on trade although i m not holding my breath     well i mean you know one other things he might notice in mexico of course is to be there to briefly but let s imagine     he took some     tour of mexico spent some time there     he was discovered that no not all of mexico is a     narco trafficking     gang land in the     murder rate in mexico is high but not extraordinarily high it s about as high as     some major     cities and in united states that you would probably if you saw relocated you there you what you would think twice     about going and has a massively productive     economy     really a revolution in the last twenty five years thanks to nafta thanks to the fact that     mexico was allowed to modernize and didn t end up     becoming a second then this whale i accepted this will a very hard on our border     he might learn that mexicans are actually coming     leaving on net     believe in the united states for mexico because there are job opportunities     it s a manufactured a major manufacturing hub of the manufacturing of it isn t stealing     american jobs in many ways is helping create american jobs     mexico because it s well here     is the primary export destination for cal for all the border states in even for a believe new hampshire mile in also brett is labor costs rise in china     a lot of u s manufacturers would love to move back production     to mexico it s it s closer and has a rule of law that we understand     so if anything we should be trying to draw mexico costs are too slow i think that s exactly right and really i think that this is an important point which is     in nineteen ninety three when or ninety two when the first torch to be bullish     toward each of the bush administration negotiated     nafta     mexico is being ahead was emerging from a dreadful     decade of     economic decline and crisis     low oil prices     an unreformed     lars the un reform state sector     mexico could ve gotten a really bad direction we could have     in mexico today almost not quite but almost what europe as whiz i wholly serious side but with north africa     such economic desperation that would be sending waves of people cross our border     nafta by helping mexico become a middle income country for all of its problems and i m probably more aware of its crimes that most the people listening in on this podcast     having grown up in the country and having the deep roots there     for all of its problems     is in fact much more prosperous because trading is in fact     the alm that i m not a zero sum game both both sides     when     mexico has become stronger mexico does have a better rule of law     mexico     does have democratic accountability     mexicans are tracked the right of center     pro business parties like the powder     which recently won seven of a number of the     key governorships in mexico     all those things that mr trump     might learn now here s the question i guess this is more to do with domestic politics in and were     encroaching on the     onthe in a neighborhood of our of our colleagues paul gbo and turig onto strassel book     is the question so     trump has been moderating his position on     the legal immigrants from deportation     no word got we ve gone from deporting all illegal immigrants on the one to     simply deporting criminals which in fact is exactly what the obama administration does     now     from a policy standpoint     it s good to see trump     become more reasonable on the subject     from a political standpoint on the other hand doesn t strike me as soon as the winner for them what you think     well it s interesting you ask the question because i didn t interview today with steve moore     our former colleague and senior economic advisor to the trunk campaign on opinion journal or     video     our on line video rather     and i am steve described trumps immigration policies and how they ve changed in     what some of the numbers they threw him came from the brookings study its twenty sixteen     immigration study specifically     in one americans are poll     on whether or not we should offer a path to citizenship for those eleven million illegal immigrants more than sixty percent say yes     i in terms of a become a legalization but not citizenship you have that number somewhere around twenty percent deportation less than twenty percent     so i think the further trial moves     towards a reasonable policy on immigration     the more he will be welcome to my republicans and independents     because independence to sit in the middle     are more likely to be in that sixty percent range you want legalization     and they are in the g twenty percent range and deportations     i would agree except that in his case of the wall deportation in     what is so central to his     candidacy ceasing to voters was in when enemy lines team was aware that i think they re they re they re two points here one of them as he would betray his core supporters for whom     the borders issue is a fundamental i mean after all he is now adopting     the position he was mocking     jeb bush and marco rubio in the so called gang of eight     for having     before     soaking loses that constituency but all he does in the process isn t in the new constituency     asia shows is another politician in the whistler really busy really lose the constituency brett because     his core constituency in white working class voters     getting vote for hillary clinton     aam and i know that that that s what love that s i think that s that i think that s really     the question i think what you re seeing really is a change in this is this is what the campaign is spinning     is that this is just a change in emphasis of course that s not true     he basically called for a deportation force but i think the way that politically bills and this is to say to that core constituency     don t worry we re going to build the wall     we just need to deal with people and what to call if you mean unfair way     so they re changing positions but     i think about for days it s can it be the wall all the time when he goes to speaks to those communities you know something     it trump any in an unlikely event that route becomes president     they re never going to build     in a build a virtual laudanum known     they re gonna build the the beautiful long they re never going to build the wall     on that note i were to take a quick break by saying the army he called it the best papa     and that will be right back and talk about     a very different subjects     jason gay sportswriter

become a subscriber on itunes boss on twitter at ws j podcast antagonists that it ws j dot com slashed contests     in the usa podcast listen ambitiously     from the opinion pages of the wall street journal     this is     more in addition     now from our studios in new york     bret stephens and mary kissel     well welcome back to foreign edition of one of the most interesting topics of the week to me mary i mean it was really quite striking     so we have this nuclear deal with the ran     the president and his administration crowe how we have     totally shut off all of iran s pounce     school bomb we have close down     there     key nuclear facilities there s no chance they could get a bomb     the rain aeon s main says comply with all the elements of the deal     and is that we now learn that then and the one     nuclear site     that is buried three hundred feet under the melbourne impervious to almost any kind of attack say perhaps     that     of the thermonuclear variety     this one side of the four no facilities some some miles from tehran     um     where     a and secret enrichment plant has now been supposedly converted into     a scientific facility     producing just a handful i guess medical isotopes for cancer patients and on     in tehran and doing other     allegedly anand and stuff     at this facility the rain aeon s and no are no ringing and     wiz     the s three hundred surface to air missile     one of the most in advance for russian air defense     systems available which they just acquired from russia     thanks in part to the billions of dollars that they can now spend on various kinds of aam armaments     um     now why are they defending to     this sunday there has     been is totally     innocuous that would never would never pose a threat to to which it can be cheaper and i can i can t imagine why     aam need because it s important to create her production facility     because why else would you go to so much trouble     to acquire     that night that system from russia and the s three hundred     and and also     the flour u s sanctions love     brett circle of remarkable things about this mean first of all     um i mean you can learn about this facility in so i think two thousand and nine yet when obama came down to the press conference     along with i think the french and the brits announced it     to the world     aam it decide was a focus of the iran deal negotiations in the obama administration kays     um in terms of for now because they allowed nuclear facilities to     remain there     the other side of this is important is the dealings with russia     we ve artie seen you on     flout     the deal by allowing salon even ahead of the rtc to go to     moscow     on the racine second while the new sanctions with the delivery of the systems     which are     prohibited     on mandatory sanctions should be put in place under several of our allies     so it is it s remarkable that this happened and it s not     a front page news     all over the headlines     every day because it really is that important and the administration and i in the guise of the state department     it s kind of explaining away and saying wow look it s just a defensive system we really have to worry about this     i call bs     and those initials those from those letters do not stand for bret stephens     um     look it s also the case that     this deal was sold on the promise that the administration with ruthlessly enforced     the letter of the deal     that there would be     instant snapback sanctions     and yet every time the rain aeon s tests     the edges of the deal by a     by ballistic missile test revise stunts     like this     the united states finds an opportunity either to do nothing     claim that the deal is and the u s which in fact it is which is to do and it s     a credit     or     of adopt a wrist slap sanctions that don t actually stop the rain aeon s from continuing to develop their     nuclear infrastructure people forget     that john kerry when he was talking up the deals during the process of negotiation     insisted that foretold would absolutely     be cloaks     now for no simply by being this incredibly extensively donegal     last friday leasing chore     news     of its site capable of of large     of large scale enrichment     is part of the asset base that iran has in terms of its     nuclear infrastructure     and with the ministrations basically doing is saying     we know one on forests were going to do everything we can to keep the steel allies     it s     it s meanings one i predicted would happen with this deal that the deal itself     is iran s biggest hostage     because are ran by constantly threatening to walk away from the deal     um     expands the boundaries of what s permitted     gets the administration s offer     more concessions     and is     slowly but surely shaking loose all of the remaining restrictions     on     of commerce and trade     and     and um     the diplomatic     um     i m losing low powers was a nice isn t it just to that point when you see in shaking loose that the restrictions on commerce     and wheat discusses some previous podcast that also creates     a pro iran deal constituency in the last     in the business community is profiting     off of these deals look at the deal that was just done for example with boeing     aam is it with boeing is now incentive eyes to use its vast lobbying power     in iraq in washington     to keep the steel why does they wanna make money     and one other things it ministrations says while the rain aeon s or filling the benefits of sanctions relief because they were clever enough negotiators     and so they didn t realize that they want to get full sanctions really     you know if the rain aeon s once sanctions relief     they can change their behavior     rather than have john kerry going around and acting as their de facto     spokes person     let s get to our last topic because it s not in significant topic at all     this week mary     the european commission which is the executive arm of the european union or what s left of that     on the european commission     um insisted that apple have to pay fourteen point five billion dollars to ireland which the government of ireland says it     is not old     and does not want a     bull     yes this is classed as make its a amaze bowl cut lewis s classic classy brussels     i you can t possibly have     tax competition within the european union he hated     and they wanna drag everybody to french level taxes     and     there s some unease in the annals purebred that the of the basic point     is that apple paid the taxes he said that it was known     in ireland ireland welcomed apple     because it won in jobs     and so on that day they ve basically interpreted their tax laws they provided a couple of letters to apple s saying this is what you will owe and or system     and the firm for years and years and years that was the deal and so suddenly brussels has figured out that they don t like this     and they want to wretch are actively strip apple of these profits just because     aam has major ramifications for investment in europe because who s going to go and invest in ireland or in continental europe     if a couple years down the road the european commission can turn around and say hey guess what     we feel like we want you to     pay a several billion dollars to speak on this one and that says the thing     that you know what they re claiming     they could make a case under tax law irish tax law that could make the case of apple had violated     any of the normal time     accounting procedures     so what they said was that apple was in effect benefiting     from any legal subsidy     and they re taking this as     an anti trust     violations who really     this is the kind of legal innovations it s typically pioneered in places like live near putin s     russia     to seize assets and to violate     of violet agreements     and a half to say you know what brussels     and euny get into trouble some people     brussels is like the trump candidacy rate     as soon as you know they started as soon as something that s going right you think ok maybe this isn t quite so bad     they do something dreadful this reminds everyone     that brussels is that     i m that     that will fly in     that huge and thinking on blinking     leviathan     that wants to stomp out every good idea wants to stomp out every     independent impulse     that anyone in europe might want to have     for the sake of what it calls     harmonization of     but which in fact is deadening and killing     the european economy     you know if you wanna trend growth in investment brussels if you wanna get out     of twenty five percent youth unemployment if you don t wanna be in a constant     the euro euro zone crisis     maybe you might wanna trying to grow the economy with a predictable fare regulatory environment     with lower taxes and and and benign tax competition     between your member states     again on the way of smart people whether they re at apple or any other company     doing business creating jobs and growing economies throughout europe     that would be a really smart idea but brussels seems intent     constantly on shooting itself     and therefore its own people in its own potential     in the fall     and break we just appreciate the irony here that the european union was created as trade union it was supposed to     connect these countries in liberal authorized to make it easier to do business here i am just so     unbelievable so     um you know what the comparison of brussels with trump was the script     in my weakness am obsessed and sometimes i think they re little right     without morgan to let it go for this week     join us     next week in
