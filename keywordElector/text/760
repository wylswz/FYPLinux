articles paying homage to the building of america at the national museum of industrial history            bethlehem  pa   almost two decades in the making  the national museum of industrial history finally opened its doors earlier this month in the restored      electrical repair shop of the defunct bethlehem steel corp    s lehigh valley plant  plagued by sluggish fundraising  county and state investigations  and allegations of mismanagement  the museum responded by scaling down its vision  now  with an        square foot space  about     artifacts and a regional focus  this smithsonian institution affiliate no longer merits its ambitious name  the museum   s impressive homage to the      centennial exposition in philadelphia is its closest approach to national themes  but that may change as the museum expands to fill its second floor  an adjacent plaza and possibly other buildings on the       acre bethlehem steel campus  for now  it has made a promising  if deliberately modest  start by focusing on the lehigh valley   s industrial heritage  a rectangular red brick structure with a new steel entrance canopy  the museum salutes its origins through both preservation and design  on its plaza  evoking a  claes oldenburg sculpture  sit two    ton gears that helped transmit power to the steel mill  in the lobby is an overhead electric traveling crane that once moved equipment through the repair facility  dangling a winch that has become the museum   s symbol  a steel beam is juxtaposed with a blown up      photograph     lunch atop a skyscraper     in which workers building rockefeller center take a midair break on a similar beam  the exhibition hall   s retro design features hanging light fixtures and gleaming exposed pipes  the first of four galleries  machinery hall  is the strongest  with a panoply of machines  many on loan from the smithsonian  representing the centennial exposition  one wall is festooned with a salon style display of wooden patterns used to cast metal machinery parts  a framed set of files from the nicholson file company and a metal shaper are actual relics of the      world   s fair  overall  the gallery captures the exuberance with which the u s  trumpeted its industrial progress  a message that apparently influenced even  oscar wilde     in america     he would write in                the exercise of ingenuity  the application of science to the work of man  is       the shortest road to wealth     the fate of the once behemoth steel company and the broader decline of american manufacturing give these exhibits an elegiac heft  massive machines such as the corliss pumping engine and the linde wolf ammonia compressor inspire awe  like fossils of gigantic extinct species  other  smaller machines   some adorned with painted and sculptural decoration   can be appreciated as masterpieces of design   wilde also wrote     there is no country in the world where machinery is so lovely as in america     the museum   s genesis  as the project of former steel company executives  naturally inclines it to celebration  especially of bethlehem steel   s undeniable contributions to city skylines  transportation and the american defense industry  museum president and ceo  amy hollander  hired in the spring of last year to replace  stephen g  donches  says she sought oral histories to complement the museum   s artifacts  both audio clips and exhibit labels highlight dickensian aspects of america   s industrial past  dangerous working conditions  low pay  child labor  unionization struggles  and discrimination against women and minorities  in an oral history  heard here in an audio recording by an actor   william major  an african american hired by bethlehem steel coke works in       says that to get ahead    i had to work three times as hard     following the iron and steel gallery  whose artifacts include factory whistles that signaled emergencies and a protective blast furnace suit  the narrative turns to the area   s once abundant silk mills  these factories employed mostly low paid women  sometimes forbidden even to sit down  on display is a jacquard loom that produced luxury fabrics for the white house  from the  hoover to clinton administrations  while steel fell victim to changing technologies and foreign competition  silk   s hegemony was challenged by synthetics  a final  industry supported gallery  distinctly boosterish in tone  discusses the production and uses of propane  a fuel that powers hot air balloons  school buses and many rural homes  industry founder  walter o  snelling based his company in pittsburgh  but later lived and worked in the lehigh valley  there the museum narrative abruptly ends   at least for now  the national museum of industrial history is enriched by its setting  in the steelstacks revitalization district  anchored by the sands casino resort bethlehem and the artsquest performing arts and community center  more interesting from a historical perspective are the remnants of other factory buildings  the high rise company headquarters  and especially the abandoned steel plant   s blast furnaces  looming over the landscape like an abstract expressionist sculpture  the hoover mason trestle  an elevated park similar to new york   s high line  runs alongside the plant and offers views of bethlehem  plaques commemorate the plant   s operation  the human toll of steelmaking  and the symbiotic relationship between    the steel    and the neighboring community  it   s a concise and powerful complement to the museum   ms
