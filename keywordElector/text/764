articles discovering art in the adirondacks at the hyde collection            glens falls  n y  when you hear    adirondacks     you picture lakes and mountains  summer and winter sports  even the eponymous chair invented by  thomas lee in      near lake champlain  you don   t think    rubens  rembrandt  picasso     please reconsider the hyde collection in glens falls  a city that has struggled with population flight and urban decline  is the benefaction of a family that made its money in the local paper mills  in        samuel pruyn co founded finch  pruyn   co  by the turn of the century it had become the largest lumber business along the hudson river  in      he established a pulp paper company  he had three daughters  they married  they built adjacent houses  they became local philanthropic and cultural presences chief among them was the oldest  charlotte              with her husband   louis hyde  she assembled a collection that is now the glorious museum that opened here the year of her death  hyde house  displaying one tenth of the collection   s       works  would be an honorable addition to any city  small or large  in the adirondacks  it is astonishing  other family collections    isabella stewart gardner   s in boston and  henry clay frick   s in manhattan   are more important and housed in more palatial settings  the hyde collection most bears comparison to smaller house museums like the mcnay  san antonio  and the philbrook  tulsa  okla   in these  we can see artworks the way their owners did  this is not always to our advantage  at hyde house  as at the mcnay and the philbrook  the pictures on the walls often suffer from soft lighting or bad placement  one might prefer the cold professional impersonality of a modern museum  with better illumination  natural or artificial  at the hyde  i craned my neck  struggling to have a closer look at a stunning little veronese painting     rebecca at the well     c         because it   s over a stairway  i couldn   t really get to it  other pictures  especially smaller ones  like  albert pinkham ryder   s    stag in the forest of arden           and courbet   s    waterfall at ornans     c         are so dark  because of both their condition and their placement  as to seem dense  clotted  almost unseeable  picasso   s         boy holding a blue vase    and  renoir   s colorful         estelle in a red hat    cry out for a better position than in mrs  hyde   s dim  austere bedroom but then you have the glories  a perfect  luca della robbia terra cotta    madonna of the lilies     c           and  in the expansive music room  a   th century serene  downward gazing virgin mary  wood and polychrome  holding a reliquary  among the paintings  the portraits are the most impressive  they extend from a         portrait of a young man    attributed to  raphael to  thomas eakins   s c       likeness of  henry o  tanner  the first african american artist to achieve an international reputation  and  george bellows   s         portrait of mary brown tyler     which gives its sitter a face painted so white as to appear mask like  even deathly the selection of old masters includes a weirder than usual  el greco      st  james the less     c          in which a creepy  anatomically confusing hand emerges from the saint   s cloak  the library boasts a splendid  van dyck portrait of  jan woverius  c         and one of ingres   s several versions of slinky  long limbed paolo and francesca            rubens   s    head of a moor     c         an oil sketch with thick impasto and vigorous rapid brushwork  confers vitality as well as sadness on its heavy lidded subject pride of place goes to rembrandt   s    christ with arms folded     c            whose history is complex  owned by count  alexander orloff davidoff  confiscated during the russian revolution  vandalized  stolen from the pushkin state museum  torn from its frame  rediscovered in       repaired  restitched and put up for sale  it was purchased by the hydes in      for         it has been over painted  over restored  cleaned and recleaned several times  rembrandt   s own hand was probably not responsible for christ   s hand  which x rays reveal was originally placed lower than we see it now  the most moving part of the otherwise dark picture  and incontrovertibly rembrandt   s work  is christ   s dazzlingly melancholy  human face  his beautiful lips and skin  his deeply set eyes  the hyde collection and even glens falls itself are thriving  in august  the city won the state   s     million downtown revitalization initiative award for the capital district region  population is growing after years of decline  the queensbury hotel  a    year old fading grande dame  has returned to local ownership for the first time in    years  and is getting a much needed makeover as for the hyde  it just received an     million donation of cash and art from the schenectady architect werner feibes  who  with his late partner in life and business  james schmitt  assembled a contemporary collection of more than     paintings  works on paper  and sculpture  pieces by albers  haring  hartigan  kelly  lewitt  motherwell  nevelson  rauschenberg   david smith and  warhol will take their place in a new wing of the museum  a collection  like a house or a city  has its own organic life  mr  spiegelman   s latest book is    senior moments  looking back  looking ahead     farrar  straus   giroux
