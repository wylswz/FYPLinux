   s oculus called the gear vr makes a compelling vr experience available under your tree for just      the gear vr is the first     degree entertainment system that feels accessible and slick  rather than awkward and sickening  if you   ve only tried freebie vr experiences like google cardboard  it   s worth giving it a second shot with this gear vr reminds me of the atari       that affordable game console that brought pac man home  right out of the box  gear vr makes it easy to access a surprisingly wide universe of games  videos  journalism and even immersive theater experiences  all curated by vr pioneer oculus  and without the need for jumbo sized headsets and price tags  samsung   s new hardware addresses much of what made earlier vr headgear uncomfortable there are some constraints  to use gear vr  you will need one of this year   s compatible samsung smartphones  like the galaxy s  or note    the phone mounts on the high tech ski goggles to transform  like voltron  into a vr machine that pumps images straight into your eyes you won   t mistake what you see in there for reality   you can clearly make out pixels  like when you   d sit too close to an old tube tv  yet using the gear vr for a week  i frequently found myself getting wrapped up in its virtual worlds  for longer and longer stretches that   s thanks  in part  to great strides from samsung and oculus in combating the urge to hurl  the nausea  which has made vr largely disappointing to date  is caused by herky jerky scenery that doesn   t match what your brain is expecting  inside the headset  you   re bounding this way and that  but your inner ear and your eyes are reporting different things but unlike other phone goggle contraptions  the gear vr headset has its own motion sensors  so it does a much better job of tracking your head movements when you   re turning or looking up  and it pushes the samsung phone   s processor to cut motion delay to under    milliseconds  reducing the nausea inducing blur   my test galaxy s  edge plus worked so hard when mounted  it could blow through its huge battery with an hour or two of intensive vr  other improvements also make gear vr much more comfortable  the headset itself is less heavy   slimmed     from an experimental headset samsung debuted last year  you can comfortably fit glasses inside  and there   s also a focus adjustment that makes the view more pleasurable for aging eyes yet there   s still some discomfort  wearing anything on your face for an hour can get old  also  i occasionally encountered what appeared to be a flicker in the brightest parts of the screen   samsung says that   s rare  and has to do with the way my brain processes the screen refresh itself  the fact that using this can result in fatigue is a testament to how much you can actually do inside a gear vr  my biggest surprise was how much real content there is now   well over     apps in the oculus store  with    coming in the next few months  after a week using it  i feel like i   ve barely scratched the surface  you can watch lebron james practice  tour the world   s beaches  even watch netflix on a tv in a ski chalet  not all of this content is unique to the gear vr  but the oculus interface you use to browse and buy it makes it easy there are lots of enhanced shoot em up games  as you   d expect  but there are also experiences that are exclusive to vr  in    land   s end     for example  you float through a beach landscape to unlock puzzles  it   s the most zen virtual experience i   ve ever had directors are also figuring out how to use     degree video for a theater like experience  my favorite  from an app called vrse  lets you visit the set of    saturday night live    during its   th anniversary special  you can spin around to watch  jerry seinfeld   s monologue and the celebrity reactions   don   t miss  sarah palin in the audience  oculus also works to keep you away from bad experiences  vetting what goes into its store  on top of that  it adds a    comfort    rating to each app  like a yelp for queasiness rival phone vr headsets lose their immersive quality because they don   t have good ways to let us select  view menus and do things other than look around  the gear vr adds a touchpad on the right side that   s equally useful for scrolling through movie titles and zapping alien spaceships  though it takes a little getting used to if you buy a gear vr  there   s one necessary piece of equipment that doesn   t come included  a chair that can spin     degrees  if you don   t have one at home  you   ll miss out on a lot of what   s going on  or just keep accidentally racking your shins on the coffee table the gear vr is a no brainer if you already have one of this year   s compatible samsung phones  if you   re an iphone owner and don   t want to switch  you can get close to the comfort of gear vr with a vr one headset from carl zeiss  but you   re on your own for curating and downloading compatible apps there are a lot of reasons to be excited about this new virtual world  but it   s important to understand what the gear vr can   t do  limited by a phone   s processing power  storage and screen  it can   t play complex games  you can wear wireless headphones  but it isn   t a surround sound experience  those are the kinds of experiences we can expect from oculus   s own rift hardware when it debuts sometime next year  and even the most impressive vr content is a work in progress   max cohen  oculus   s vice president of mobile  told me he thinks of the gear vr less like an atari  and more like the first game consoles  from the early     s  that were capable of   d graphics  in those days  game makers didn   t know how far off in the distance to draw objects  or what a first person experience should be like today  vr content makers are learning what kinds of immersive experiences feel right  like moving in straight lines instead of up and down     we are still figuring out the medium     mr  cohen told me based on what i   ve already seen with gear vr  though  i   m ready to strap in for the ride  write to geoffrey a  fowler at geoffrey fowler wsj com
