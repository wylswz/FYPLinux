and the challenge gets quicker and harder cognitive training games like this one  double decision  are designed to improve brain functions and are at the center of a growing body of research looking at their effectiveness as scientists strive to find ways to ward off the cognitive declines that usually come with age a government funded study published this month found that playing double decision can slow and even reverse declines in brain function associated with aging  while playing crossword puzzles cannot  the study builds on an earlier large trial which found that older people who played various cognitive games had better health related outcomes  driving records and performed better at everyday tasks such as preparing a meal such research has led groups like aarp  the big seniors group  to jump on board and offer discounts for certain games that have shown proven benefits  doctors who work with the elderly say they get many questions about so called brain games and exercises  despite promising study results  some doctors say there still isn t enough evidence to prove such exercises will help people in everyday life   what they do is they train you with a computer program to do better on a test  of cognitive function  said  barbara messinger rapport  director of the center for geriatric medicine at the cleveland clinic in ohio   but does that mean you do better on real life activities that utilize those skills such as driving    or managing your medications     fredric wolinsky  lead researcher for the latest study and a professor at the college of public health at the university of iowa  said previous studies have demonstrated there are real world benefits to playing certain computer games  including a reduction in depression symptoms  a study published in      as part of a multi year  government funded trial  known as active  showed that participants followed for six years had a     lower rate of motor vehicle accidents following cognitive training  said dr  wolinsky  who didn t participate in that research  the study appeared in the journal of the american geriatrics society the latest study  called the iowa healthy and active minds study  published this month in the online journal plos one  was a randomized controlled trial involving     healthy people  participants were divided into two age groups   from    to     and    and over  people in each group were assigned either to play road tour  which has since been renamed double decision  or to do computerized crossword puzzles  some did the exercises in the lab and others at home  double decision briefly displays an image of a vehicle and a particular road sign  as the screen continually shifts  and assorted vehicles and road signs come and go  players must watch out for and identify the particular vehicle and sign that appeared at the game s start  the game becomes more challenging as players advance levels  forcing them to quicken their mental speed as distractions multiply and images become harder to distinguish  the study  which was funded by the national institutes of health  involved playing the game a minimum of    hours over a five to eight week time period  one group played for an additional four hours after    months before beginning the study  participants were given standard cognitive tests  many involving executive function tasks such as concentration and shifting from one mental task to another  the results were ranked relative to the average performance on those tests for the participants  age group  the same tests were administered a year later  people assigned to do crossword puzzles showed typical cognitive one year declines  dr  wolinsky said  but the groups who played the computer game showed a clear improvement compared with the normal loss of cognitive function as people age  the amount of improvement ranged from two to seven years  depending on which executive function was being tested  people who worked at home improved at the same rate as those who were in the lab  improvements in the younger group matched those among the older participants   that s really important   said dr  wolinsky  it suggests  we are able to start the recovery process sooner  rather than waiting until the cognitive decline has become so large  the study followed similar research   the active trial   also sponsored by the nih  in that trial  about       elderly participants showed improved memory  reasoning and visual processing speed after playing an earlier version of the double decision game  said dr  wolinsky  who also worked on that earlier research  the active study also tested the time it took to do daily activities  like preparing a meal  and performance tests  such as reading price tables to pick the best telephone provider  dr  wolinsky said  participants showed improved performance compared with those who didn t get such cognitive training  in the latest study  dr  wolinsky said he chose to use the updated double decision game in part because it is available for home users  in comparing computer game use with another activity  he said he chose crosswords because many older people enjoy the puzzles and the general perception is that they keep the brain and mind active and engaged  san francisco based posit science corp   the company that makes double decision and other brain games  expects soon to participate in multisite studies looking at the impact such games could have in delaying or possibly preventing the onset of alzheimer s disease  said  michael merzenich  a professor emeritus at the university of california  san francisco and chief scientific officer of posit science  aarp recently began offering its members discounts on several posit science games  said  deborah abernathy  director of aarp brain health   their exercises  specifically  we found were very helpful  they re fun  they re short and they re easy to do and they re online   she said  dr  wolinsky said he doesn t currently have a financial relationship with posit science  he did consulting work with the company for a total of    days from      to      as part of the analysis of the earlier active study  he said dr  wolinsky said the next study he expects to pursue will use functional mri imaging to measure changes in the brain in people participating in cognitive training exercises  he said  p   murali doraiswamy  a professor of psychiatry at duke university medical center in durham  n c   said the iowa study was one of the best and most rigorous to show the benefits of brain training in older age  but a problem with brain training games is that people often get bored and don t continue with them   it s a very promising area   he said   i think what we have to do is we have to make the games fun
