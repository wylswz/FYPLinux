articles ron meyer hollywoods mr nice guy            when ron meyer appears in the front doorway of his        square foot beachfront home in malibu  wearing baggy gym shorts  a black t shirt  flip flops and day old whiskers  the    year old vice chairman of nbc universal looks less like the most enduring chieftain in hollywood and more like your favorite uncle like its owner  the home   a modernist design by the late architect charles gwathmey   is a temple of order  structure and discipline  meyer  who provides strategic guidance and counsel on nbcuniversal   s entire portfolio  film  tv  theme parks  resorts   routinely wakes every day at      a m  and spends an hour working out in his personal gym  then he reads newspapers   including the los angeles times  the new york times and the wall street journal   while eating breakfast in his home   s pristine dining area     everything is in a line here     he says  gesturing toward the wood floors and stainless steel railings     everything is on a grid  and if you look at the screws here  each one is exactly the same direction     he shrugs     i   m a little anal retentive    similar orderliness applies to his corner office at universal   about an hour   s drive away at the foot of the hollywood hills  in the office  which houses three of andy warhol   s mao silkscreen portraits  even his pens lie in a straight line  by the time he arrives each morning  after fielding calls on the drive in  he takes around     a day   he   s made his to do list  which always includes reminders to call his children  his son  eli  and daughters carson  sarah and jennifer  eli      is a student  carson      is pursuing an acting career  sarah      is a senior vice president at joel silver   s silver pictures  and jennifer      is a jewelry designer with an a list clientele  jennifer aniston   jessica alba  and a movie star husband  tobey maguire  meyer is the industry   s ultimate people guy   one whose every major professional accomplishment was born of his human touch  people skills explain how a high school dropout and tattooed ex marine co founded the vaunted creative artists agency in the mid      s and personally guided the careers of tom cruise  sylvester stallone  barbra streisand  meryl streep and cher  among others  when universal studios was looking for a new chief  in       those same skills won meyer the job  he ran the place for    years   the longest studio reign in hollywood history   thanks to his ability to produce major hits  including erin brockovich  gladiator  a beautiful mind    mile  meet the parents  the fast and the furious and despicable me many  or most  of those projects have been built on his relationships in hollywood  where everyone calls him ronnie and where he serves as friend and mentor to a diverse array of industry players  his loyalists range from old school  michael douglas  steven spielberg  to new school  kevin hart  jimmy fallon  angelina jolie   s connection to meyer dates back to her childhood  he represented her father  jon voight  at caa     the interesting thing about ronnie is he   s so straightforward  very levelheaded  and he   s ronnie to everybody     she says     i don   t associate him with the stereotypes one has about people in his position  he   s clear and honest   you never have a problem with ego       i   ve known him long enough to call him ronnie     says fallon  who has been seeking meyer   s counsel since the tonight show host   s saturday night live days     he   s got that thing you can   t get in school  street smarts  he can hang with anyone and relate to all classes of people    hollywood   s top earning actor  dwayne    the rock    johnson  says meyer is    like a second dad    to him  he credits meyer with giving him the confidence to transition from professional wwe wrestler to movie star  johnson   s first film role was in the mummy returns         which was a hit for universal  johnson says     i was nervous  i was unsure  ronnie took me through a        foot perspective  he was very influential in my career at a time when i really needed guidance  ronnie is an anomaly in our business  he is an incredible amalgamation of elegance  brilliance  focus  care and warmth    meyer often puts it another way     here   s the deal   in order to be successful in hollywood  you don   t need to be an asshole    last year  thanks to the collective success of jurassic world  furious    pitch perfect    fifty shades of grey and minions  universal pictures earned      billion in worldwide box office   the highest grossing year ever for a studio  the company   s theme parks are booming  no wonder  then  that meyer recently signed a five year contract extension meantime  he   s prominently featured in james andrew miller   s splashy new book  powerhouse  the untold story of hollywood   s creative artists agency  an oral history with industry titans in which the author charts the company   s groundbreaking founding and plumbs meyer   s epic falling out with michael ovitz  one of caa   s famed founders  at the moment  though  meyer isn   t looking to publicly pick a fight with ovitz or anyone else  including all the media and industry types who periodically predict his imminent retirement     i   m still here     he says with a half smile his spirits are high  for one thing  he   s eager to watch his wife  kelly  paddleboard in the pacific  for another  bourne  the latest installment of the film franchise produced by universal  is in the midst of a      million opening weekend worldwide   the film has thus far made a solid  if underwhelming       million      internationally  it   s the highest of any bourne movie     meyer says     so we   re thrilled    meyer has already reached out to the movie   s key players  including matt damon and director paul greengrass     there was a time when i used to call everyone  but i sent very happy emails to the bourne cast and the executives in the company     meyer says     i   m the old guy in the company  so i figure they should at least know i care     entering the studio grill  a wolfgang puck restaurant on the universal lot that   s one of his regular lunch locations  meyer  who even as an agent eschewed wearing suits  is in blue jeans  sensible brown moccasins  a dark blue shirt buttoned to the top and his customary wire rim glasses  he can   t walk five feet without being approached by an endless series of suits  executives  marketing guys  jockeying for face time  he greets each one warmly and by name  a full nine minutes elapse before meyer gets from the maitre d    station to his table  where the visitations slow but never stop  he always takes the same seat in the same back booth  beneath a poster for a      sci fi movie called the mole people  before he arrives  a waitress makes sure his place setting includes a bottle of water  no tap meyer   s punctiliousness took hold when he was in his late teens  he was raised in a working class section of west los angeles by parents he describes as    fabulous but very simple people     the late edward and edith meyer were first generation jewish immigrants who   d escaped nazi germany  ron figures he inherited his business sense from edward  who worked as a traveling dress salesman  and his optimism from edith  whom he describes as    a guilt free jewish mother    during his early years  however  meyer often got into trouble  he dropped out of high school at age     despite his modest size  or perhaps because of it  he proved adept at bare fisted street fighting  he was arrested more than once and didn   t find meaningful structure until he served a six year stint in the marines  beginning in the early     s  while in service  he caught the measles  ended up in quarantine and received a care package from his mother  it included the most influential book meyer had ever read  because  at that point  it was one of the only books he   d ever read  he says   the flesh peddlers  by stephen longstreet  chronicled the pulpy exploits of a hollywood talent agency for which  as its cover touts     lust was big business     meyer saw a future in being an agent  he used a tenuous family connection      my mother   s best girlfriend   s husband   s sister     who was married to an agency head   s brother    to land an entry level job as a messenger at the paul kohner agency  where he learned the guiding principles that he follows to this day  write everything down and return all phone calls  six years later  meyer scored a junior agent gig at the biggest show in town  the william morris agency  where he toiled alongside a fellow grunt named michael ovitz  temperamentally  the two were polar opposites  meyer was a genial soul looking for camaraderie  and ovitz was focused on dominating hollywood  but both were hungry  smart and ready to strike out on their own  in       meyer and ovitz  along with bill haber  rowland perkins and michael rosenfeld  founded caa  which for a period was furnished with card tables and folding chairs  the founders    wives also temporarily took turns answering the phone meyer   s way with people  coupled with ovitz   s tactical jujitsu  gradually enticed clients who   d tired of william morris   s hegemonic reign  in the late      s  caa   s biggest clients were sally struthers and rob reiner  by       it represented robert redford  dustin hoffman  robert de niro and the lion   s share of hollywood   s top notch talent  in the     s  caa would launch several megastars  will smith  sandra bullock  and represent powerhouses including tom hanks and bill murray as caa bent hollywood to its will  identities hardened  ovitz was the alpha   a brilliant and ruthless businessman who lived and died according to sun tzu   s art of war  meyer was the beta   a cool headed diplomat who championed clients  defused crises and led by example     he taught us a great deal about the art of being an agent     recalls caa   s current president   richard lovett  whom meyer hired     ron loved his clients  he really cared  so when the leader walks his talk  the rest of the agency finds it very easy to accept that this is how we work     lovett adds     if an agent didn   t return a client   s call  ron would be deeply and truly angry  he would find that kind of disregard for another human being and their feelings beyond unacceptable    in the     s and     s  meyer enjoyed vast power and eight figure wealth  but trouble arose  he and his first wife  ellen  divorced  he dated actresses  including ali macgraw  and developed a high stakes gambling habit that  according to sources in the book  occasionally put him in the hole  and  not least  he had an acute case of    ovitz fatigue     as caa types called it  by the mid     s  meyer planned to set up shop as an independent producer until ovitz  being ovitz  had another deal in mind  the new owner of universal pictures  seagram ceo  edgar bronfman jr   wanted ovitz to run universal  and ovitz wanted meyer to come with him to run the movie studio  shortly after the principals reached a handshake agreement  however  things got weird  bronfman blamed ovitz for making additional financial demands  ovitz accused bronfman of walking back on his initial offer  in any event  the deal imploded  enter david geffen  the billionaire co founder of dreamworks skg  who urged bronfman to hire someone geffen liked better than ovitz  ron meyer  by his own account in the book  ovitz didn   t take it well   when meyer took the reins at universal  in       he faced a mountain of skepticism  that he   d excelled at managing actors in no way meant that meyer   who had no formal business training   had the stuff to run a publicly traded  billion dollar movie company  universal had long been the domain of two iron fisted traditionalists  sidney sheinberg and lew wasserman  who ran the place like old school british headmasters  meyer  with his penchant for blue jeans and bonhomie  seemed as though he   d get eaten alive over the next few years  meyer oversaw enough big ticket duds  waterworld  mchale   s navy  blues brothers       that he feared the next one could be the end of him  meyer   s apprehension led him to back out of a commitment to make titanic   a project that paramount and fox later parlayed into what was then the highest grossing film in history     i punked out     says meyer     i deserved to be thought of as a short timer  i was in over my head way more than i thought i would be  i had a lot to learn  and those first three years   i feel very fortunate that i survived them    even after the studio began producing hits   erin brockovich  gladiator  meet the parents   meyer still felt vulnerable because the company changed owners frequently  his corporate overlords would include seagram  vivendi   barry diller  general electric

 and comcast  each of which required him to prove himself anew  asked to name which new ownership change made him feel the most vulnerable  meyer shrugs     every owner     he says     each time a new owner came in  we anticipated that they would make a change     he grins     and  by the way  so did the press    meyer   s ability to win all of them over defied the laws of hollywood  where studio bosses have short life spans     new owners quickly learned that ron could be counted on     lovett says     the input he was giving was accurate  they could trust him  they could believe him  and he was creating a bridge between a new owner and an insular business community    geffen attributes his friend   s success to several factors  first  he says  meyer wisely    stayed away from choosing which movies the company made        i   ve always thought that younger people really have to be making those decisions     meyer explains     i look at some of the films that were very successful  and the truth is  i wouldn   t have made them  or i would have made them differently  so i know that that   s not what i should be doing    also  it   s a solid insurance policy for meyer  a few years ago  when universal hit another fallow period   remember cowboys and aliens or battleship    meyer took responsibility     if you   re going to take credit for your hits     meyer says     you   d better take a lot of blame for your flops     unlike the executive who had green lit those films  however  meyer survived  then universal hit a hot streak that included ted  despicable me   and six other films that opened at no    unlike other studio bosses  geffen notes  meyer embraces being    the no    guy        ronnie gets along with every person who   s bought the company  that   s very unusual  i would say it   s never happened  and it all comes down to his skill with people    the human touch that made meyer a great agent gives him an edge as an executive     ronnie knows it   s always about the talent  and that we all serve     says lorne michaels  the saturday night live impresario     if you ever forget that  you tend to be gone  it   s never about you    jolie credits meyer with giving her the wherewithal to direct her      war drama  unbroken     what was amazing about the process was that ron and the studio didn   t make it easy     she says     he made it clear that i wasn   t an actress but a director and that i had to prove myself  that taught me how to make a bigger film  i felt very direct communication  very strong guidance    that meyer is known as the town   s king mensch can be deceiving     don   t let ron   s mayoral presentational style fool you     spielberg says     when it is tough out there  there is no one tougher  if i can make a comparison to battlefield generals  he is less like general george patton and more like general omar bradley  with a smile on his face  he gets the job done    anyone who   s ever worked for the man knows that to defy his code of behavior is to do so    at your peril     says donna langley  chairman of universal pictures     he has an extraordinary work ethic  and he expects the same of those who work for him  you   ll hear from him if you don   t  he   ll call and tell you how you screwed up and why  and he   ll be right       it   s understood that you don   t want to be his enemy     says michaels  who likens meyer to a    smiling cobra       you know what gives you the reputation of being a nice guy     meyer says     you treat people the way you want to be treated  and you return phone calls and give people answers  i   m not a nice guy because i say yes to everything or because i do what everybody wants me to do  people should never mistake niceness for weakness  i think peace is better than war  and i can be had once  but i can   t be had twice      meyer is feeling reluctant about an event he   s scheduled to attend this fall at the director   s guild theater  in a rare public appearance together  he and ovitz will sit down for a    conversation    about the caa book in which they offer clashing anecdotes and accusations  the central conflict involved their messy effort to leave caa for universal  in the book  meyer says ovitz accused him of stealing his job and that he responded     no  mike  you left it in the trash can  and i retrieved it    the most farcical dispute pertains to real estate  when meyer was initially mulling whether to buy his lot in malibu  in       he solicited ovitz   s opinion  shortly thereafter  ovitz bought the land for himself without mentioning it to meyer   ovitz says he had already been in discussion with the seller   ultimately  ovitz sold meyer the property  currently the only home he owns by all reports  their ensuing feud raged for years  gradually  though  given their    year history  the hard feelings gave way to a kind of detente  and they have been speaking to each other meyer treads carefully when discussing where things stand with ovitz but gives credit where credit is due     mike and i have a very long and complicated relationship  but i do know this   i wouldn   t have gotten this far without him     he says     he pushed me farther than i would have pushed myself    while ovitz wasn   t available for an interview  he did provide the following comment     i have deep admiration for ron and the success he has achieved  i am immensely proud of what we all created and accomplished together    meyer says he gives little thought to retirement  he doesn   t even like long vacations  the longest one he   s ever gone on   a    day family trip to africa in        was a stretch for him  he   s a bit of a homebody who spends most weekends in malibu  eating breakfast at nobu  shooting pool  he   s played since he was    years old  and watching half a dozen current or forthcoming movies in his    seat home theater  he   s typically accompanied by family  which includes four grandchildren  and friends  the latter group often includes his longtime neighbors  and ex clients  michael douglas  barbra streisand and james brolin  also  he   s active on the charity circuit  he annually co chairs a fundraiser for the simon wiesenthal center   s museum of tolerance  and next year he   ll receive the organization   s prestigious humanitarian award mostly  though  meyer remains a workhorse with increasingly broad and general responsibilities  since he became nbcuniversal   s vice chairman  in       he   s served less as a manager and more as an   minence grise     my family always asks     so  tell me what you do  what do you do     it   s always hard to describe it because every day is completely different     he says     there are so many things that need to be done  and there are so many things that are a waste of time  but all of it has to be dealt with    meyer thinks of himself as the mayor of a small town   one that happens to comprise        people worldwide  in recent weeks  he   s made work trips to orlando  florida  theme parks   las vegas  bourne premiere   london  more bourne  and new york  comcast   he   s in new york every other week     times a year  for meetings with nbcuniversal   s ceo   stephen burke  and expresses confidence that the corporation isn   t just another fly by night owner     everybody knows that comcast is very much here to stay     meyer says     they   re completely invested    as evidence  he cites the company   s recent      billion acquisition of dreamworks animation  whose hits include shrek and madagascar  meyer played a key role in the deal  before that  he and comcast conspired to revive the company   s floundering theme parks  the clincher came when meyer turned to his old friend barry meyer  chairman of warner bros  entertainment  and persuaded him to share a portion of warner bros     lucrative harry potter franchise     other people could not have done that     geffen says     that   s pure relationships  and that   s what ron does     the wizarding world of harry potter has since become a blockbuster attraction at three universal parks  with more on the way   collectively  the theme parks   in hollywood  orlando  japan and singapore   now earn more than    billion a year on the hollywood whisper circuit  the biggest criticism leveled at meyer is that universal   s production slate has grown increasingly conventional and risk averse  more than a third of the films on universal   s      roster are sequels  the rest tend toward bro comedy  talking animals and magical orcs     as a movie company  every single movie is a risk     meyer argues     if there were sure things  we   d all be billionaires    he points to universal   s art house division  focus features  whose credits include dallas buyers club and the theory of everything  but both of those films were developed and co financed by other companies meyer frequently notes that his job is to make profits  not art  and has acknowledged that one of universal   s most celebrated films  a beautiful mind  probably wouldn   t get made today because it would be deemed too commercially limited  and the two films he   s proudest to have overseen  brokeback mountain and united     were made more than a decade ago when asked if he has a professional endgame  meyer offers a blithe    no     when asked what he   d do if hollywood were no longer an option  he shrugs     i guess i wouldn   t have to do anything     he says     i wouldn   t need the money  and this is what i do    moments later  while exiting the studio grill at universal  meyer arches an eyebrow     wanna get the golf cart     he says  semi rhetorically     yeah  let   s get the cart     in a flash  he commandeers a golf cart and steers along a roadway that snakes through universal   s vast  hilly backlot  shortly before reaching the house featured in alfred hitchcock   s      film  psycho  he narrowly passes a packed tour bus coming in the opposite direction  he seems pleased when he started at the studio  he says  he   d look around this rambling backlot and think it lacked the style and refinement of the lots at paramount and warner bros     but now i look around this place and think it looks really beautiful     he says  and floors it
