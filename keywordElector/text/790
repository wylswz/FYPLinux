   s         cost of care survey      i am due to begin required withdrawals from my retirement savings  what are the advantages and disadvantages of an annual lump sum withdrawal as opposed to a monthly payout  in most cases  a required minimum distribution  or rmd  in the form of a single annual payout causes fewer problems   if you have a good amount of self discipline yes  monthly withdrawals act like a regular paycheck  but  to take a worst case scenario  if you die midyear  your family must withdraw the remaining rmd  says  carolyn mcclanahan  founder of life planning partners inc  in jacksonville  fla  figuring out how much has already been withdrawn and how much remains to be withdrawn can  at times  be a hassle with a single lump sum  you can deposit the funds in a savings account and then arrange for monthly transfers to your checking account  creating  in effect  a regular paycheck  and if you wait until november or december to take an rmd   when you have a clear picture of all your income for that year   you can calculate your tax withholding on the withdrawal more accurately the one cautionary note about a single annual withdrawal  willpower  or the lack thereof     some people spend it all at once if they take it as a lump sum     ms  mcclanahan says  i have a question about paying my grandchildren   s tuition  i understand that if i pay the institution directly there is no tax consequence for my grandchild or me  does this apply only to tuition or does it include room and board  the answer  just tuition  but you have some flexibility here to start  the    tax consequence     in this case  is the federal gift tax  you can give as much as         in cash or other assets to as many people as you wish each year  and those gifts won   t count against your  the giver   s  lifetime exemption   in all  you can give away       million before gift taxes kick in   if you exceed the         ceiling in a given year  you have to file a gift tax return  that said  there are exceptions to these rules under section      e     of the tax code     any amount paid on behalf of an individual as tuition to an educational organization    is exempt from gift taxes  note the wording     tuition     period  there   s no mention of associated costs  like books  room and board  etc this shouldn   t stop you  however  from paying the grandchild   s tuition   and then either gifting him         to pay room and board  or paying room and board up to         directly  says  barry kaplan  chief investment officer at cambridge wealth counsel in atlanta  and if both grandparents are alive  each can gift          for a total of          my husband started taking social security at his full retirement age  but continued to work  he is now    and still working full time  over the past    years  his benefit has gradually increased because of cost of living adjustments and his continuing contributions  via his paychecks  to social security  i am nearing full retirement age and am trying to figure out how much i would receive as a spousal benefit  i know that   at my full retirement age   i can qualify for half of my husband   s benefit  but do i get half of what he started receiving    years ago  or half of what he is receiving now  including the adjustments to his benefit  your spousal benefit would be based on your husband   s current payout  including the cost of living adjustments and any increases tied to his continued wages  to get a better idea of how much the spousal benefit will be  says darren lutz  a public affairs specialist with the social security administration  your husband can create a    my social security    account at socialsecurity gov myaccount to see what his full benefit is  before deductions for medicare premiums  etc  then you can visit the agency   s retirement planner for spouses at socialsecurity gov women to learn more about potential benefits  ask encore  written by mr  ruffenach  a former reporter and editor for the wall street journal  and co author of    the wall street journal complete retirement guidebook     examines financial issues for those thinking about  planning and living their retirement  email your questions and comments to askencore wsj com
