also what is wells fargo s new ceo going to stay in a break it down for u s     is ninety     wall street     now marks as the new york     europe armenia and stephen dresser     hello everybody welcome to the moneybeat podcast poland stephen here in the studio     and energy known for you all know earnings season is just on now underway my favorite time every three months every three or four times the year better than christmas baby     four times the year so earnings season     of college at adelaide this week became an earlier     poll it is really going to be in focus on the banks and on friday     when they tried     to delve gigantic means for you     not just try fact it looks like     a undercut pnc     at my house our     area on the irs     one fat so what is my middle and lower than them or what is it     on the four big banks report jpmorgan city wells fargo and t     p and c     and to preview that we ve run into of our top     minds and the centers ranks     rachel louise ensign and earned the charity     let s talk some bank earnings folks on for idle question     why why all these banks are going on friday morning it basically the same time     why are they doing their toolbox that without trying to cover all right today check with its own     i don t think they did to them but jpmorgan usually goes for just that any they are on the first day and joined by wells city     it s kind of quirky the calendar but this time there s a lot of news out of wells pharma because of a new ceo     it also will make his debut on the call on friday see usually jpmorgan gets all the eyeballs in the spotlight     but this time a lot of people being focused on wells fargo s well i would     normally be focused on that more than even the earnings numbers and obviously earning numbers are outraged re just yet but in the night     is that they focused in the new ceo whether quarter itself is is going to be interesting but not expected to be of groundbreaking you know a quarter in terms of heat increases or declines     commercial lending soft now which rachel wrote about the sweet hereafter and talk about the wall street businesses are mixed but building and some momentum from the second quarter this is the first quarter will see server postcrisis from the banks how     the markets reacted how that the european businesses look to the drawing interesting stuff to look at     under that that that that that the four big banks reporting on friday     however with wells there s     a whole host of other questions regulatory because their sales practice scandal     and just the new ceo thrust into the spotlight     in plants or to bring him and over time around parental a knife was in the city and tim sloan is the new ceo kowalski replaces john stumpf who     resigned abruptly and wednesday     down to the plan was generally thought to be strong would take over once completed sixty five year old retirement age     i aam but because of the scandal some laughs nap early and     effective immediately slow takes over tilda the     two calls time on friday     and the question for them as ok     even as bank that everyone had to look too with the halo     and they took a lot of market share because the work he s doing things the right way in because they re pretty aggressive sales culture which can be much press     i aam     now they re sentiment panel about so the question is how i how long     it is at last come if this is that they lose and will will folks but in different banks and pnc and jpmorgan get the few with wells like the results are     very secondary     it really gonna be a focus on what     oslo s says     on the call and what steps they are to be to move     past this sort of scandal     yet i mean it s it s pretty un usable     post prices for the sort of thing to happen consider that     the last time the big six bank i m lost its ceo     mitt romney and barack obama were tangled in a tight presidential race so it s been four years since the big man lost its ceo     that s one victim and left citigroup costs half as likely when in doubt then owned in trivia     and michael corbat took over     i m just on the ground well since two thousand and seven said a lot of alot of found stability in the corner office is a big thanks in part of it because the crisis was so destabilizing     that regulators and shareholders and pre much everyone involved wanted so the stable leadership that banks not a lot of     moving parts unknown internal use these types of things are frowned upon     aam     and so very stable leadership in all the big banks but this     this is that the first thing can be seen in awhile one other things that you looking at the analyst notes this morning that was us cents with wells     but     it has a deep bench down     you know where you are you know that     this is going to transocean and on the scene isn t always a big deal when you because he out     that they had a management team in place but this was not going to be a bit     the change     yet with a prominent read it did look internally down     tim sloan has been the bane for by three decades but has never been closely affiliated with the retail businesses found which are the ones where sales practice candles     happened     and     it just did to upset that for second assail scandals generally involve have     tellers bankers people who work in the branches signing up customers unwittingly for credit cards in     accounts they didn t ask for     sometimes leading to unwanted fees     and hurting those customers credit score so that was real damage     i really broke the trust and in many ways it s something that you d never imagine of a reputable bank would do     such a grand scale     so     tim sloan     has been cfo and chief operating officer the company but didn t really his hands dirty in the retail business is enough to be targeted yet     i mean investigations are ongoing we ll see where things will be but     she was views the best person to take over non notably he s not the chairman of the outside     chairman stephen sanger from general mills     a retired ceo there     is going to run them for     and as well be the ceo celeste less power in the ceo now been banned for so the change a wells fargo and friday morning is the really the first time the public gets to see     it s good to look at angus ask questions to write down in some ways it s it s not totally surprised when unfolded especially given that the two congressional hearings that john stumpf the old ceo one to one so badly right now static slowness to turn the page star fred deal with a much friendlier audience for shareholders     you know     there s a lot more to talk about refilling in your story     and with a mormon thanks for back taxes if is for a good     time to take a break is in the eye makes the wells fargo thing     separate so let s take a break where they come back on the other side of this passage     the gatineau time quentin for trial to many markets in more we talk about them as fascination personal

did it     about one specific business lines for the banks are co op bank earnings was     what to do business line the banks     that had a surprisingly weak third quarter     he has said that federal reserve data show that     the commercial and names so mundane from banks to businesses     i ve basically just stopped growing one square impacted down a little bit     and that s the first time in six years that it s happened and     no one really knows why this is happening here a lot of theories on one thing ceo basically said     anyone s guess is as good as mine     so it s a bit of a mystery by its staff falling not good for banks because     things have relied on very rapid growth in these loans to businesses in the last two years     and said keep their loan growth up on and kind of help forestall the effect of low rates which are very back from a profit from right is is is and what it s sort of the that business lines that have     so so i m getting is that has been one of the business lines of this ruse or slowness in other     areas     so now if this goes down to that becomes an even bigger problem yet a staff are a lot and analysts are saying this is gonna be one and the biggest issues for banks in the quarter you know there been some downgrades to earnings expectations     the sun     and     it s just     i think on the costs are going to get a lot more contacts as to     why     this is happening in the bank s him maybe some the csf have     developed a peak and that s why this is that they talk in september last     aam but yet i it s basically just a big mystery and it s     really not good for banks to be happening     is the interesting lee economist london weisler an economy as slowly     the fed is trying to send one to raise rates and what the reaction will be one when rates go up and it s really interesting data point that that corporations have     taken a pause and when you read that are good i mean you listen to him fed chairwoman janet yellen talk     and one of the machine concert cox does business investment is you can directly to that     and a lack of sort of business investing there were getting     into this year and     really since the end of the financial crisis yet it s efraim view that a lot of that growth i mean     the annual growth rate on these sites across banks was in the double digits further in two years after the crisis     alm so there is a view that that was pre unsustainable at a time when gdp wasn t really paying that much just have companies     borrowing and barring an borrowing on when there wasn t much underlying economic growth and that     was good and some days and     that day maybe now     that it could also look and look at the end of the fed in its minutes     talked about you know sort of like oh too much leverage on them     balance sheets     yesterday     some you know those two can also be connected to the sharing     on you know companies increasingly when her top     yen in the one other thing here they were saying that s that s interesting on this front is distinct ilan berman is changing of enemy mna would still high last year in in in recent years that     bear as that s bound cooled off a little bit there s less need for for debt fuelled spending and mlb owes     and buybacks of slowing down to     my right now i mean in the stomach     and read a lot of that was on the short run     yes i mean the question that then i am on this is whether after the election down     some of this comes back or you know you ve been in sch thing datacom embrace it was a very big     distraction for the markets are taken into a m and the semi to put it off some     now new suv election in november     in addition to a lot of uncertainty out there for dealmaker i think what the banks are hoping for is that all it says is that     greg s it     scared companies off from barring more making big investments in the end     of the craziness around the election has also done the same and then when it s over everything all resume and     double digit rates and eni designed to collect hidden     treasures need to watch all this content is well they re just mesmerized by this     raises the kid table as i did because the alternative is that the economy is slowing down and has installed one expand their prey to work on seven of borrowing is much     to eternity is that this ends up not being a one off exactly that that feel turn and i think that s really really scary for banks for other reasons and     yet it not into that a little bit here and there battle otters think     of or not share all maybe it s writes a even empty of these things to know international operations that i write about the regionals     notes     on the plus side that consumer businesses are looking fairly healthy unemployment continues to be up for that bullish sign jobs     creation     and the yet the energy sector which is a big concern in the first half of the latter part of two thousand fifteen is is stabilized and so that s good for banks will really worried about high white house what s impaired loans     lots of bankruptcies in the energy patch     that stabilize someone is oil prices into the floor and bounce back all of that     that s very good for the banks of the comes in     the commercial lending might be a sore spot this year for banks there s a lot of other things     that are doing ok but are prevented from being a very rough quarter for the likes of b of a and goldman sachs said he was on with     it just retaining their violence     historical lows in july     how was the mortgage market aam innocent looking for banks     and especially given that the housing market has largely been a bright spot for the economy     of this year     and then the palm mold mortgages does seem like they re too costly to be a bright spot     it s one that takes the planning management as opposed to commercial and borrowing     is actually up from the prior quarter so it seems like it     it could be dead on and and then     in tears every picture on the commercial side     on the     field even though we did see rock bottom rates trade after frantically trees would of been horrible for banks to continue through the corner     aam one benchmark alive for has actually moved up a lot     and that need help thanks to not not he adds that the pummeled by     what happened to my great janney lines short term interest rate is important is that the only read that that     kind of is important for banks and life or is this race commodities     has worked out     some of the longer term bonds have also seen ieo so that s     that s good for banks may help the     he always closely watched name was its net interest margin for those not in the years     but i was going to get them out     of     the big picture though here     i was going to do it what what an album     the dilemma so while were on the same around the same way point restaurants are exactly where i wanted to go home and took the picture     generally speaking i mean you know you have the more you monetary policy of regulatory policy across the globe     it does not create for banks     banks are struggling especially having to see this in europe but it s still true that very true in the united states     are struggling to make money     a howler these numbers cuddle up in comparison     to past years i guess well that s a great question the big picture     is not very sunny for banks and in the quarters find     it try not to be a home on saturday via strikeout either     found     but that the pictures banks     don t make the     money that these two they don t take the time to rest these two     and more more people are saying well they re not supporting the economy like these two they can t make loans     and     as freely they can that take risks that really and that hurts the economy are telling greg ip ever to come on this and this week to look at     them     and thinks price to book ratio and there are still cheap data shows people are worried about     whether banks will continue to make money and do what they ve always done for the economy so     some real interest in the papers every time looking at their centers have a tug a war between     cigarette what i would call the federal reserve     establishment viewpoint that     you hafta have tons of capital to keep banks safe     um and that s the best way for them to move for and keep the economy growing     the alternative you with skin on a paper that was caught them by larry summers not that long ago     that said     will     capital s important     banks are making enough profit and people are investing in banks and growing     debt can be bad for the economy as well we need to look at whether this long term service sluggishness in the banking sector     as some not ill effects were not taken into account what was this is the metric that they look to calm summers     in terms of     the the the expectation of bank shares are going to fall by a house or was a for profit to fall by half     compared to the financial crisis basically saying     the outward to     proffer bench and shareholders     seemed so was worse and was     in two thousandseven prior to the financial crisis with a look at the dahlia direct putting a     value of their share price and i get to that question out even if you have tons of capital in cash and some lines in it people don t have confidence     in you that     that is the prom for the banking sector and then     you know     the fact that there s now a lot of confidence that they ll grow     aunts and prosper and be     so good picture way     down     it trickles down to the concern that they ll be healthy enough to sustain a crisis and yet the investors buying think stocks     based on what they think the fed is going to do next at this point and     right now work on a misty that these everetts release simler where we were last year when     the old people and we did all of twenty fifteen for a fed hike the key was going to come     each time during the meeting it finally came in december and thinks that everything was guinea get better me before i     in twenty sixteen and and we ve had none     and so the banks are really dealing with office in town visiting there making money     they re not not posting all australian bank     it s hard and in it when you talk to bank executives he s still the sense that     your doctor mentor and cooling than they were before the crisis and     it s not as fun     picture brings a formica point it s     simple keys to invest in banks for now for a lot of investors is the fed will raise interest rates and that will come formulaic lee expand their profit margins     it s very cyclical and it doesn t seem very secular it doesn t seem very     bullish for the long term view the economy that that most of the reasons people want to invest in banks because they     are super cheap and the     brits made up fifty basis points     yet     i learned i d i think it s interesting to think you know that view is like     when i was concerned about them this assert blowing up     but     we re concerned about them ever making money     and that s a fair concern gap and that s a really if you re a of stock surged concern     yes i think at this point i mean     every quarter and it seems like there s something new via the thought that things couldn t get     temporary thought it couldn t be more of a grind for banks that it is and then there s     brags that then there s the flattening of the yield curve know     now there s the wells fargo a situation which i think all the banks are probably gonna have to     address on the earnings calls this week you know what are you a merry taking away incentive compensation and i think most banks had half a look at this and     be evaluated and     that s more regulatory costs that s potentially     be a losing cross selling revenue to back off of that so     it s it s a silly something else that seems one small silver lining is that the banks haven t been pummeled this much in the political debates yes i m     it s her as they were the primary center that s and then that could be a     that could be a sign that that that perhaps a mature fat jump on this bandwagon yet     perhaps that the deep anti tank sentiment is     is changing but there is some     b  sser recognition that that banks have to be profitable     and growth for the economy to become a     carol adelson festival     in     tennessee i know that yet he did his younger brother stuff     and not out on the jump in on the medway     like big as any i     like to look into the bandwagon at that point     of all     high     yield will be looking at     earnings on friday morning from the big banks and the chatty rachel louise ensign thank you very much     the wrong thing
