articles designing beyond chloe inside clare waight kellers parisian home            the fitting model was standing in a sheer  gauzy frock whose many pleats around the bottom were scrunched and folded this way and that  held in place by dozens of pins  when it floated down the runway at chlo     s fall winter      show in march  it was a billowy number splotched with colors like sunlight bouncing off a lake  it   s wispy  wood nymphy stuff that falls loosely on a coltishly feminine  boyishly rumpled creature that the brand has dubbed the chlo   girl here in the studio in paris   s eighth arrondissement  a month earlier  the dress was still just a monochrome mock up  and  clare waight keller  chlo     s creative director  was scowling dubiously at it  pulling out pins and then sticking them back in     could you please go take a walk     waight keller  who is english  asked terribly politely  the model walked back and forth across the fitting room  and then she did it again  and again  something about all those pleats just wasn   t falling right  being a fitting model generally calls more for stillness than exertion  but here  the model was back and forth all afternoon  as waight keller scrutinized each piece to make sure the flou   the french term for the whole category of skimpy  flowy fabrics   had the proper flounce  it turns out  inventing insouciance is painstaking work    chlo   is so much about movement  it   s so much about the feel of something     says waight keller      who joined chlo   nearly five years ago from pringle of scotland     when i came to paris  i hadn   t worked a lot with flou because it   s an extremely difficult fabrication to work with if you can   t physically move and drape in three dimensions     i had always worked in systems where you hand over a sketch and technical details  send it away and wait for it to come back  a flat sketch doesn   t describe the volume you   re talking about  the cuts you   re talking about and the drape you   re talking about  at gucci  we used to sketch flou y dresses  and when they came back  you   d just go     oh god  that   s so bad     working with an atelier down the hall is a huge advantage  i can say     cut this in five different fabrics     you need to test it constantly  to refine it constantly    it   s clear that when it comes to chlo   and clare waight keller  the flou fits  for one thing  waight keller walks and talks like a quintessential chlo   girl herself  porcelain skin  thick brown hair hanging loose  jeans and a man   s button down  and an unruffled     i   m ok  thanks    vibe  she   s easy in her sneakers  as the french say  you want to hang with her the same way you would want to hang with chlo   clients like  say   jane birkin or marianne faithfull  who was perhaps at her most chlo   when confronted by the cops at keith richards   s house in       clad only in a fur rug     i   ve always thought women look better naked     said  gaby aghion  chlo     s founder  i met with waight keller at her cavernous apartment just off the bois de boulogne in paris   s   th arrondissement  it took her a while to get used to all those grand haussmannian rooms strung out end to end   her   year old son  harrison  loves making endless loops around them on his scooter   she and her architect husband   philip keller  also have twin girls  amelia and charlotte          i don   t think i   ll ever live in something this size again     she says  sounding wistful for the small farmhouse by the sea in cornwall where she loves to escape  the apartment is a welcoming  unfussy space  filled with odd things picked up casually along her way   her grandmother   s lamp  a funny photograph of pubic hair with a marmoset by ryan mcginley  he shot ads and a film for pringle of scotland when waight keller was its creative director   a huge map of new york from when she lived there     i got lost in the west village so many times      another photograph of painting palette tests by the artist jenny saville     we collaborated on a scarf based on these tests  so this was quite precious      everywhere there are chairs  which she just can   t stop herself from buying  and in front of waight keller   s bedroom fireplace stands a phalanx of her shoes     all good girls should have a shoe fireplace      nothing about the apartment feels as though it   s straining for effect  which  as it happens  is a bedrock principle of chlo   girlism  the kitchen is a huge  bright room  with a big  heavy legged wooden table that encourages sitting around  and that   s what waight keller had in mind when she moved the kitchen to what had been the apartment   s dining room  she   s got a different favorite spot for solitary sitting around  it   s one of those small corner rooms that are frequently found in old paris apartments  its high portes fen  tres facing south and west     i end up being in here a lot  sitting on the sofa and slogging through things     she says     you get sunlight all afternoon here  and it makes such lovely shadows  i love looking out the window at the moldings on buildings across the street  it just feels so paris to me    it may not be a house rule that chlo     s designer must be a chlo   girl  but it clearly helps  the way chlo   works  and has always worked  is to build the brand around the imagined persona of its emblematic customer  for this summer  waight keller rummaged through the wardrobe of the      s and pulled out a pair of track pants  just because     i was thinking  i   ve done big flare  and i   m sick of wearing my boyfriend jeans  so what do i want to wear now    chlo   makes much of the fact that it has no curlicue c logo or other branding iron to stamp its product and  by extension  its clientele  it doesn   t pay celebrities to show up in the camera   s crosshairs at its runway shows  says geoffroy de la bourdonnaye  a former disney executive who joined chlo   as chief executive the year before waight keller arrived  instead the brand relies on the influence of the brigade of fresh faced chlo   devotees who fill the front row     we are not a brand that screams     he likes to say  that makes for a tricky balancing act  however  waight keller   s designs must project a precise idea of who the chlo   girl is without defining her so narrowly that all the not chlo   girls of the world feel rejected  richemont  the brand   s owner  has big plans for chlo    and they don   t include playing haberdasher to a ya ya sisterhood of insiders   richemont doesn   t release chlo     s annual sales  but exane bnp paribas analyst luca solca guesses      million   de la bourdonnaye would even let  kim kardashian  arguably the world   s un chlo   iest person  join the club     i wouldn   t want to say she   s not a chlo   girl   anybody can be a chlo   girl     de la bourdonnaye says expansively  waight keller has managed to thread this needle deftly by taking herself and what she wants to wear as her starting point  rather than a bunch of disembodied adjectives  she designs clothes first and fashion second     women need to desire clothing  so even when i   m in fittings  i think  would i want to wear that     waight keller says     it   s at the heart of what i work on every day  that for me is the trigger point that makes it real  instead of just something for a shoot  it   s something you really want in your wardrobe because you know it   s going to make you feel great  i think it   s harder to feel that if you   re a male designer  i have a couple of guys on my team  and i   m always having to challenge them  they   ll say     oh  this looks really chlo       and i   m like     yes  but i don   t want to wear that right now        this corresponds to the spirit of gaby aghion  who created the brand in       gaby and her husband  raymond aghion  arrived in paris from alexandria  egypt  just after the war  they quickly fell in with the smart set at the caf   de flore on the left bank  haute couture had its mailing address on the right bank  where christian dior  jacques fath  balenciaga and schiaparelli had been cutting and sewing during the nazi occupation  aghion had a strong sense of style  not to mention a fair amount of money  her husband   s family was in the cotton exporting business   she bought a few balenciagas and a few diors  but she couldn   t afford to dress that way all the time   who could    and besides  she didn   t want to  she discovered to her dismay that there really wasn   t much else in the way of stylish  well tailored clothing  it simply didn   t exist 
   you   re thinking  oh god  do i need another tight skirt  it   s about adaptability   understanding the flow of fashion    
shortly before her death in       aghion recalled how she pretty much conjured pr  t    porter out of thin air     one morning  i woke up thinking     i will make a little collection of charming dresses in very pretty colors that women will fancy        i designed six dresses  hired seamstresses with haute couture training  borrowed a friend   s name  chlo     which i liked for the roundness of its letters   and hand painted the label with one of my artist friends  i wanted it to be amusing  i then decided to personally propose this collection to boutiques  i was sticking my neck out  i was a client  i became a saleswoman  i had sass  i was light hearted  and i had a hell of a lot of nerve     she wrote in the      book chlo    attitudes  over the years  chlo     s choice of designers  both under aghion and since      under what is now richemont  has been astute  aghion handpicked a pre chanel  karl lagerfeld in the mid      s  and the two developed a warm working relationship  the chlo   girl remained in sure  sisterly hands under  stella mccartney and  phoebe philo  who was mccartney   s design assistant before taking over in       and then  for a few years after philo left in       chlo   stumbled  enter waight keller  whose disjointed r  sum   makes her oddly well suited to lead chlo   at a time when bigger things are expected of it  early on  she picked up the artisanal chops needed to elevate everyday wear to something finer  when she was growing up  her mother hand stitched the family   s clothes in their modest birmingham home     that   s one of my first memories  standing there and my mother saying     don   t move  don   t move  i   m going to pin you  don   t move         she says     then  as my sister and i got older  we had to become her helpers  she hated how i pinned patterns because i   d make too much of a bubble in the fabric   little  subtle things that i didn   t realize at the time became second nature when i got to school  when they tell me now that something is labor intensive  i   m like  really    after graduating from london   s royal college of art with a master   s in fashion knitwear  she was thrown into the hurly burly of      s new york as a designer for calvin klein  it was the ideal place to acquire some armor plating     i   d never seen a cockroach in my life     waight keller says  laughing     calvin klein was a little dry on the design side  but you suddenly went voom  to something very commercial  it   s about being sure you shift the big numbers  that kind of hard core  brutal start makes you really tough really quick    at ralph lauren   s luxurious purple label  she got essentially a doctorate in detailing and construction     everything is in the detail  ralph works in millimeters  a lot of people say     oh  it   s an old fashioned look     but there was a lot of depth to what he did  no matter what you see on the surface  he would say     i only want shirts that have a    piece collar     and i   m like  really  a collar can have    pieces    perhaps the boot camp that best prepared waight keller for chlo   was the drilling under  tom ford at gucci  where she landed in       this was ford   s heyday at gucci  when the brand   s image was so sharp and so seamless it looked laser cut  ford was responsible for that     he   s extremely rigorous about things     says waight keller     that   s something that   s always been in the back of my mind at chlo     making sure the message is very consistent  i   m the guardian of the brand     she learned another lesson at gucci  too  when to soften the hard edged story line     as much as i loved working with tom  you get to a point where you feel a bit saturated with the look  you   re thinking  oh god  do i need another tight skirt  it   s about adaptability   understanding the flow of fashion  which i try to sense intuitively all the time    if there was a bump along the way to chlo    it may have been paris itself  with its brittle codes and persnickety way of doing things  at first  it threw waight keller     when you live here  you have a very different perception than most people   s romantic notion of paris  it   s quite an uncompromising city  you have to fit your personal life to it  not the other way around  sometimes you can be really irritated by it    but as she has throughout her unlikely journey here  waight keller adapted and ultimately thrived  she has learned to love the afternoon light from her corner study  where she flops on the sofa when she gets back from the studio  she walks harrison to school every morning and plays tennis with the twins every weekend in the bois de boulogne  just across the street  the butcher says bonjour now  she   s made paris work for her  at chlo    she has turned paris   s insular  uncompromising standards to her advantage  too     it   s allowed me to work with fabrics i   ve never worked with before  like lace  lace has since become a huge part of my signature  for me  that   s quite empowering     she says     in the beginning  somebody in the atelier told me     we don   t care what   s going on elsewhere  paris only competes with itself     i think that   s what makes paris the strongest and most creative city in many ways  there are things that are frustrating  but then you change what works for you
