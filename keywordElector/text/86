it   s been a year and month or so since i moved from india to silicon valley    it   s been rollercoaster ride for sure  the transition from bangalore to bay area hasn   t been easier  here are the   thing i noticed or learntspend on experiences  it makes you richer  i work and move around with colleagues who are in younger demo graphics  but i think they have richer experience than i do  many of them live on tighter budgets  but they seem to spend on experiences  they invest in sail boats to latest gizmos and spend endless hours passionately restoring something  they live more carefree than i do almost everyone want   s to build next big thing  although i have seen herd mentality back in india when everyone wants to enroll in same college or follow the same foot steps  i feel here it is more amplified  almost everyone want to build uber for x  chatbot for y or tinder for z  i have met many passionate people focused on weak ideas or mislead by short gains  and it   s terrifying to me that they are willing to put so much money and energy on those ideas  i am more convinced than ever before that we need to make technology address human problems easy to see the change that will impact the world  this is almost opposite of previous point  companies like fb  google  uber and other startups are innovating and creating the pieces of tech that is going to drive next generation of innovation  some of these innovation are going to create lot of turmoil as world needs to shift in adapting or accepting this    ai machine learning which as taken up considerable front seat in tech is going to change we interact with every thing    i have not felt so anxious in my own ability to adapt to these changes  i am trying as much as i can to learn and listen it   s all about the network  i was big proponent of building the network  i have seen it help me immensely in my career  i feel whole silicon valley is focused on this networking  it   s more profound here than any other place i have been in my professional career    right kind of people will open right door for you and it pays to be extrovert here  if you make effort you will meet lot of right people who are extremely good and passionate in what they do  many of them are ready to share knowledge and experiences if you are willing to ask and learn  i love this part of being here and having access to so many talented people   more people will stay in rented houses and will retire to uncertain future  this seems to be underlying theme of society in us not specific to silicon valley  housing is super expensive and not everyone is earning    k or to going exit with million dollars here in silicon valley to afford house    younger generation although well educated here in valley finds hard to get stable and long lasting career  as they are exiting colleges with huge loans  i really feel they have most uncertain future of all previous generation    lack of focus in younger generation choices and avenues that are available for them to spend makes to much order to plan   although many other things i have learnt through experiences of mine in past year  but one thing i have realized for sure is that siliconvalley and it   s people are not reflective of general society in usa
