what does it take for an idea to become reality it   s kind of a trick question  because there are many ways for an idea to take shape and be born into the real world some seem to appear fully formed  others come with a lightning bolt of inspiration that   s followed by months or years of meticulous  laser guided focus and incremental improvements but there   s another route to reality that is my favorite  because it is the most exciting  and  for me  the most rewarding  it   s when you start with one idea and get to work  only to realize that over time  through that work  your idea has become a totally different thing         a better thing  one that has taken on a life of its own ubercentral is a great example of this last way when we started what would become ubercentral         our service that allows businesses to request and manage rides for multiple customers  patients  and clients         we didn   t realize its true potential  how that realization drove ubercentral   s design is  i think  a story worth telling of kluges and conciergwe are always eager to learn how people are using uber in the real world  and their ingenuity never ceases to inspire us  we   d found that many hotel concierges were using multiple smartphones to order uber rides for their guests  a clever workaround to get around the fact that our app was designed with single account  single device users in mind  when faced with several guests at once  hotel staff were unable to order rides for guests without having access to multiple devices obviously  this system was less than ideal  and it was only one of several unique constraints  hotels had no easy way to bill rides to their customers    rooms  which would challenge product adoption  more importantly  hotels in and of themselves didn   t constitute a compelling enough business case to justify designing and building out a product this massive at a lot of companies  this would have been the end of the story  chase an idea for awhile  sure         but if faced with what looks like a dead end  you cut your losses and move on to the next thing that   s not the way it works at uber    a bunch of startups within a startup   one of my fellow designers has referred to uber as    a bunch of startups within a startup     i think this feels exactly right  at uber  everyone         designers and engineers  individuals and teams         is encouraged to take the initiative  starting up new projects  coming up with new ideas  and then following the thread to see if it leads somewhere interesting  and if you see what looks like a dealbreaker  keep going considering these challenges  we realized that what was special about our idea wasn   t limited to hotels         we recognized the many other potential clients who could be better served by a centralized platform that   s where the fun really began  once we stopped thinking of it as    uber for hotels    it became    uber for hotels boutiques hospitals senior centers community services   anywhere that would be better served by a centralized service   and ubercentral was born aunt millie and the bodystormwe worked with common courtesy  which was created to help people with limited mobility and inadequate access to public transportation  common courtesy introduced us to people who taught us about other user needs we   d want to consider to start working through these unique design constraints  we created an invision prototype  and then we brought together product managers  engineers  and members of our legal and research teams for a session of    bodystorming            basically a physically active  improv style version of brainstorming if you think the word    bodystorming    is a little silly  try doing it   you   ll feel a lot sillier  but that   s really the point  by getting outside of our comfort zones and physically acting out different roles  we made sure we weren   t taking anything for granted while testing out different scenarios  my personal favorite was one aunt millie     a senior citizen without a smartphone needs a ride home from her physical therapy appointment    by thoroughly investigating the process through bodystorming  we were able to identify potential pitfalls and iterate in real time before putting down a single line of code teaming upnext  we were ready to bring in the engineering team  from then on  design and engineering essentially lived together all the way up to launch day  at uber  we are firm believers in cross functional teams  we don   t simply    throw designs over the fence    with engineering on board  we had a functional prototype within weeks  because our engineers are basically superheroes  we first tested in house  sending a few willing guinea pigs to sightglass  a local coffee shop  this was a big deal for us  the first time at uber that a rider wouldn   t need an account and wouldn   t be using the app  needless to say  it was a little nerve wracking  but luckily we only lost two designers  which is acceptable just kidding  everyone made it to the coffee shop without a hitch  from there we moved into beta testing  working with retail partners  hotels and senior care facilities  this collaboration has yielded some unbelievably helpful feedback and research to help take this product to the next level  since launching in july  we have seen ubercentral used in a range of situations         ferrying customers to bloomingdale   s  trips to in n out burger for a late night double double courtesy of hotel angeleno  and returning mobility and access to people who would otherwise find it difficult to participate fully in their communities one of the most rewarding experiences i   ve ever had in design was hearing back from some people in this last group  before ubercentral  these men and women had thought of uber  if they   d heard of it at all  as    something for young people going to parties     they had found their own freedom of movement severely limited  for these folks  ubercentral has reopened doors they thought were permanently closed  and become an integral part of their lives lived in the community leaning into serendipat uber  a creative  self directed approach isn   t only encouraged  it is essential to our design environment  when the original concept for a project doesn   t pan out  we don   t view it as lost work  but as the starting point for a new series of questions         questions that may lead to even more interesting discoveries  it   s been incredibly gratifying to be a part of ubercentral  to watch it take shape and move in unanticipated directions  i   m excited to continue working to broaden uber   s accessibility for everyone  and i can   t wait to start work on the next great idea   and i hope i don   t recognize it by the time that we   re done service design    ux strategy    aspiring retired golfcreating great experiences that shape the way people move through the world  work with us  uber com
