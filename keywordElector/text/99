yet anoth saa account platform you re on the cut edg of market go figur luckili two decad of experi spam errr cold prospect peopl ha taught me plenti of trick about how to get peopl read and respond to my unsolicit email here are some of my favorit tip don t capit anyth in the subject line your high school english teacher would probabl be piss but b b saa prospect email with subject line that don t have ani capit get open more than subject line with proper capit for the record thi wa also true back in my spammer day but the open rate increas wa closer to also the worst thing you can do in your subject line is includ all cap word like free trial open rate go down by a whop tip a pictur realli is worth a thousand word short email word or le get a higher respons rate than medium length email word and an higher respons rate than long email so how do you say a lot with a few word a possibl add a pictur interestingli short email with imag improv the respons rate anoth more interestingli the pictur itself doesn t seem to matter within limit of not be offens obvious sinc product imag are no better than includ funni meme or gif i tend to use the latter btw i like quickmem to creat meme and giphi for gif tip email sent on saturday get better open rate but lower respons rate email sent on saturday get better open rate becaus there s not a much competit for attent but the respons rate that is the number of repli compar with the number of open go down thi trend is true for both consum market spam and for saa sale but i don t know whi the email are le effect on weekend my best guess is that peopl are more like to flag email a someth to respond to later and then forget you might be tempt to send email dure the week to get a higher respons rate but my team ha learn to valu high open rate the next tip explain whi tip recipi who open your first email are more like to respond to subsequ email in an absolut sens even the best respons rate to cold email campaign ish are still quit small so a minim improv in respons rate on email sent dure the week isn t a import a get a higher open rate by send email on weekend becaus you can alway send more email in other word don t expect to get a respons by send just one email send a seri of email while pay close attent to the peopl who open your first email sinc they re more like to respond to your follow up email you ll need some sort of email open track softwar to get thi info my team us rocketbolt becaus it s free and work with gmail there are similar tool for other mail platform tip use fwd at the begin of an email subject line back dure my spam day ad re at the begin of a subject line work great we tri thi with our b b prospect email and respons rate went down we even saw an increas in angri email howev for b b email use fwd increas open rate specif the tactic is most effect a part of a follow up email you can basic just forward your origin email and add a short note to it along the line of check to see if you saw the email i sent last week forward below tip send the email from matt everyon know someon name matt use thi to your advantag by send email a though they re come from someon at your compani name matt note specif the absenc of ani last name the email will appear in the recipi s inbox a be sent by matt and your open rate will increas becaus recipi will think your messag is from a matt they alreadi know

georgia make a differ to the tune of an increas in respons rate whi doe a serif font matter i don t know for sure but i think the visual differ it creat somehow add to a sens that an email is person tip includ a call back number with an area code from the recipi s locat thi is a subtl trick my team is actual still test but earli result are good in our cold prospect email we ll includ someth along the line of or feel free to call me on my cell anytim at and then includ a voip number with an area code tie to the recipi s locat no one ever actual call the phone number though we do have them properli rout in case they do instead includ a number with a local area code impli that we re local and peopl are more like to work with local compani for phone number and rout we re current use call fire it s a littl pricey but it seem to do what we need tip add a link to your websit in the first line of the email alway alway alway includ a link to your websit in the first line of the email peopl can t help but click on that link in fact of the peopl who actual open our email click on the link to our websit thi is fantast becaus even if the person doesn t respond you can still retarget them
