her maiden name is steiner  my former last name is jonker  looking at us  you would not guess that we would have unmistakably european names  i appear to be the average black male  and though you can tell she is mixed with something  she also looks black  the reality is we are both also persian by heritage  i am half persian and she is a quarter  we both have persian baha   i lineage dating back seven generations to the time of the founder of the baha   i faith   of which we are very proud the    traditional    western practice is for the woman to take her husband   s last name  because we are in a patriarchal society  there is no significance to this practice other than men were in charge a long time ago  and this practice is really nothing more than a vestigial structure of a much less developed time in humanity we all have thousands of last names in our family history that have been lost through marriage  the last name you have right now is the product of chance  a man in your family a long time ago chose your last name  then he had a son who had another son who had another son etc  the history or every other last name  unless recorded and passed down to every descendant  is basically forever lost  what is your mom   s maternal great great grandfathers last name  you   ll probably never know  and that   s okay women have taken their husband   s last names in our society and others for as long as stories have been told  this does not mean that those women didn   t value the families they came from because    we    trace our lineage through the man  i have been handling questions from my family and friends about the name change aliyah and i made a list of the persian last names in our family and picked the one that we liked the most we chose marandiz it is not a name we were born with  it is not a name that other people we know also have  it is our name         one that reflects an aspect of our history we   re proud of  that history is one that does not place the history of a man above that of a woman  that history places the equality of men and women as a fundamental aspect of humanity  that history gives us the peace of mind that regardless of the last name we chose  we would still be part of one human family and do our best to honor all sides of our history product manager   designer   hovercards  instant logos    previously  capitalon
