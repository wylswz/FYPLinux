thi transcript ha been automat gener and may not be accur i whatev would like to know what the stock market is go to do in the futur merril lynch ha a pretti good ye i m jack otter editor barron s dot com under pact wire privat wealth manag at merril lynch paseo year technic number crunch or quantit guy have put everyth into a formula and what they come out with well to head with two differ point of view to shop in there they re good to great aunt we think we enter a secular bull market in two thousand thirteen and newli what that mean is you secular bear market usual last for ten to fifteen year and we broke out of a secular bear market in two thousand thirteen weekend boston to fifteen fifti and the essen p and we think now we re no longer term korean where the essen p is go to go up on our quantit folk um think that the essen p five hundr ha veri high probabl that a nineti percent probabl of hit thirti five hundr by two thousand twenti five um and so that would give you a total return if you held the essen p five hundr over the next ten year of about nine percent no appreci plu dividend are actual are a technic analyst the market go a high a fifti five hundr over that same time curat low longer um that s typic what happen in the second ball so we re pretti optimist about equiti support realli were not a optimist about the other asset class to stock we think are realli the onli game in town for long term investor so to get nine percent in year one or two thing ha to happen either earn have to ramp up for investor willing to pay more for those earn a increas other multipl go higher is it both of those one of those that that consist of a higher number realli onli one thing is that peopl to buy stock and you realli asset class compet with each other so you when you talk about valuat and such um you know you can look at valuat no stock compar to where they were starkli ha yet to compar stock to catch the bond and real estat your choic it s um we feel that higher qualiti stock blue chip stock are go to be in a bull market we do not feel the same way about war on stock we re realli say is we think that valuat of re re re higher a investor begin to pay more for premium for those compani that can deliv solid and consist earn have free cash flow are high qualiti are can ago in a busi becaus of a new app aam and and we think investor will do what they ve alway done which is underpr asset class and an overpr asset class over a longer time so i m i would imagin that will finish next ten year with stock trade at realli realli like the two issu that we were at the end of the last in nineteen nineti nine and we were in the high point of and no i don t think that s whi they don t have to get to get the right to have to go befor it happen you and i will shoot anoth video annual warren hondura what s go happen but in the meantim there are a coupl of sector that you d like particuli right now a let s start with health care chair so i think you know it when you re look at the market overal i think you wan na have some essen p exposur for sure becaus if you think the essen p zinni to thirti five hundr that so that you should make them when we do that it actual sure whi but also i think you have to look insid your asset alloc say hey you know what you know i m not to have the safeti of my fund that have histor becaus when the next time we have a recess coupon are can appreci a much a they have histor so i think you have to think about your equiti view of the more conserv than perhap you were histor in what you own becaus if there is that there will be of cours recess and so forth would be protect said that i would be look at start to overweight some sector of the market that are under valu and out of favor one of those is health care on ever sinc hillari better for st healthcar stock been under pressur on health care stock in that sector in gener ha had the most posit earn surpris in ani sector over the last twelv month aam is thu free cash flow for the onli place we can rais price mean price are go up six percent there were where els are price go up six percent and honestli the long term trend for health care is tremend a the world get older the demand for for drug and for servic healthcar servic is a weaken grow and not just in the unit state especi in emerg market soon a peopl have well the first new do is trade up their health care so veri bullish about health care longer term by health care sector fifteen sixteen time earn right now which is realli realli cheap and i don t think it s there s ani momentum there wa no momentum they re all it s not a place for you to make great return in the short run but i think if you re a long term investor thi is a defens corner the market you should be ad to the index s the healthcar nix had a good run post obamacar until a he said hell is an app that sweet and histor kill care great time to buy health care obamacar pass pretend laughter so when you have these polit pressur often i think we over to the downsid in your mind after break the reason whi i think that particular for health care to clifford drug stock um if you look at healthcar expenditur right of the eighti percent of health care cost are in a hospit cost that twenti percent are drug problem is polit the park do we all see is the drug cost cuz that s what we see we go to the cv or wherev so we see that part so that s the most polit but politician know if you cut off the suppli of great new drug you re increas the cost the hospit right to seiz drug keeper at the hospit which is worrisom cost are so i think it the end a cooler head with tail and run compani will be allow to earn an appropri profit in order to pay for the research and develop we all need in order to live longer healthier life one more sector index technolog see some opportun there with tech is not a cheap honestli tencent decent run the sheer wa blast the begin of year but then again technolog are veri high qualiti space to make a product that everybodi need to buy and whether we have a recess or don t have a recess or grow stronger slow compani are go to contain invest in tech to keep their cost down so demand for the product is veri high the compani in the busi are trade at veri reason valuat except for the social medium stock that are not includ in that group and here s the catch wa terrif and the leverag to howev to thi is a space where when time are tough here in great posit to get through them and it s true demand for their product innov happen is also anoth sector were just what america need and is thi someth you can index deep for stock pick in that area you know the last seven year our research ha been suggest it s not a stockpick s market it s been a veri difficult undertak individu stock new been better off probabl invest in index is indoor invest in sector i still think that becaus it hasn t paid own individu stock you should be in sector with the market begin to chang i think which are begin to see is that were were move into the second phase get a littl bit closer to get back to what i would call stockpick s market where there s real differenti and stock in the same sector but we re not there yet so i would stick with it ye i wa sick of health care etf and stick with the tech etf for now um and then i think probabl new year or two the the the cyclic win will chang a thing to begin after turkic individu stock thank you jonathan beukelman a wealth manag at ub see opportun in domest stock and oversold close end fund and is also ad exposur to european stock shep gordon the
