someone wrote asking me about a term i used in one of my posts     i love product as hero     the person said     where does it come from     i responded that it   s been around a long time  although it   s frequently forgotten or abused i told him i used the term in my novel  since the main character  sam bennett  is an ad man  i wanted to show what would happen if he stopped selling products and started selling himself  not an easy thing to do in your late fifties     product as hero is simply what makes you special     i explained     for instance  if you were selling yourself  what would be the primary reason for purchase       you mean  why would someone buy me     he asked    exactly     i said     i   ll throw another term at you  in advertising  we have what   s known as why buys  this is a list of product benefits  when we   re writing advertising  we look at which why buys promote the product best  in other words  which ones make the product a hero       so what were sam bennett   s why buys     he asked    he discovered he was a good painter       artist       house painter       so you figure we   re all missing our true calling     he asked    not necessarily     i said     some people are exactly where they should be  but that   s why you should make a list of your why buys  maybe you   re in the right profession  maybe not  try selling yourself and see    i don   t know if he followed my suggestion  too often  we say we want to change  but then we fall back on routine  if we   re doing well at our jobs         or our life in general         why question our destiny  what   s so wrong with where we are now  aren   t we doing the same as everyone else as one woman said to me in a comment     we marry  have kids  do our jobs  provide food  education  job done    we never imagine our paths being anything else  yet i read a disturbing article where attendants in an old age home described dying patients having the same regret     i wish i   d done more with my life    my favorite quote is    my only regret is that i don   t have more to regret     i wish i did have more to regret  i wish i had made more missteps  failed  found myself questioning this whole idea of my direction  even when i was writing my first novel about destiny  i wasn   t sure i   d found my own was i even a novelist so often  we worry about failure  forgetting that the most successful people failed many times  even at their true calling   steve jobs failed  he was fired from his own company at the tender age of thirty four   what makes someone continue doing something they failed at i don   t know the answer in jobs    case  other than he traveled for a while  he sat on a mountaintop in nepal  maybe that   s where he made a list of his own why buys  what made him saleable  he created something that was important to the whole world  he was a good communicator  he saw things other people didn   t see  was he in the right profession  based on his why buys   i   d say so  he was at the start of a revolution  revolutionaries see the future for the rest of us  though  it might not be as easily defined  by writing down our why buys   at least we understand our own self worth  i don   t mean what we own  i mean what we offer as valuable  are we valuable to others outside of being employees  partners and parents the next step is determining the reason to purchase  i know i   m making it sound like we   re all commodities  but it   s worth thinking about  if we want to avoid saying on our deathbeds     i wish i had done more with my life     then we have to know our human assets for instance  say your list of why buys  has more hobbies than professional attributes  does that mean you aren   t fulfilled in your job there   s nothing wrong with outside interests  except for the obvious  your energies are divided  you   re serving two masters  which might appear as though you   re not focused  then again  maybe you   re too focused  maybe your hobbies give you clarity  something your job doesn   t offer in either case  it helps to know who you are  if you were to summarize your strengths  for instance  do they align with where you are now  and is what you offer attractive to an outside audience  would people buy you in advertising  we try to put that in a headline  using as few words as possible  it   s not for the sake of brevity  although it helps   we essentially want to get to the main reason for purchase  what is the most salient point if you were to write a headline about yourself  what would it be  once you   ve done that  list your why buys  can you make a persuasive argument in under a hundred words  if you   re a big believer in content marketing  go for two hundred words  write a whole chapter the length isn   t important  this isn   t a resume  it   s strictly for your own use  maybe it will be a resume one day but  for now  it   s you who has to be sold  not some future employer remember at the beginning when i said that product as hero is often forgotten or abused  think of all the advertising you see  how often does the name get lost in the production  so much of advertising today forgets that they   re selling something i see this as a reflection of ourselves  we   re so busy with the production of our lives  we forget we   re the product  that   s exactly when opportunities pass  and we end up wondering why we didn   t do more with our lives what do you think  should we be doing more  or should we be satisfied with what we have  and are   let me know at   email  protected
