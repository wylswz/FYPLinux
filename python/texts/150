the fda the polit of food can be a touchi subject on the one hand most peopl care deepli about guarante that their food is safe on the other not mani like be told what they should and shouldn t eat issu such a these are at the heart of what the food and drug administr see a it mission robert califf commission of food and drug at the fda and susan mayn director of the fda s center for food safeti and appli nutrit sat down with matt murray deputi editor in chief of the wall street journal at the journal s global food forum to discu the challeng surround food and public health edit excerpt follow mr murray there s a lot of confus or conflict inform out there how can the fda make thing better ms mayn we have a big public health mission we re concern about thing in our food suppli like too much sodium how do we help promot health by work with industri to make a healthier food suppli often peopl focu on the food born ill contamin side of thing but don t think about the chronic diseas in our countri today the top killer are heart diseas cancer diabet diet relat chronic diseas i want to be sure peopl realiz that healthi eat is a tool to reduc the rate of these realli preval chronic diseas i want consum to be confid in the safeti of produc and fruit and veget and that s one of the thing we re work on mr murray are there thing that have fda approv right now that aren t optim ms mayn mani industri have been tri dilig to reduc sodium in food the question is what are the altern industri ha indic to u there may be some challeng we might be abl to help with make sure that there are healthi altern with the updat nutrit fact label ad sugar will now be declar i would expect that some compani will be use fruit a a sweeten rather than thing like high fructos corn syrup so by put someth on a label we can help incentiv a healthier food suppli mr murray talk a littl about the redefinit of the term healthi and how that process is shape up with regard to food label mr califf what s healthi in the long run i would bet a we get better data will depend somewhat on your gene and what you eat i ve interpret what we re do at the fda a mostli tri to nudg societi in the right direct with entic and better inform hope it s begin to work ms mayn healthi ha a regulatori definit that said the product couldn t exceed a certain amount of total fat satur fat etc contain benefici nutrient a well some of that scienc ha chang over time i ve work in nutrit polici for almost three decad and the monument shift in how we look at that scienc is realli strike my train wa in nutrit biochemistri and the term fat realli doesn t mean anyth there s polyunsatur monounsatur satur omega s omega s each one of those mean someth specif to me but what s difficult is take that complex and give it to consum in a way that they understand what the scienc realli show is that the type of fat matter and that higher fat food can be healthi a long a the predomin sourc of fat are monounsatur and polyunsatur fatti acid so under the old regulatori definit of healthi certain food would not have qualifi while the dietari guidelin say these are healthi food that s whi the fda want to relook at thi issu of the term healthi what should it mean what do peopl believ about that thi is again a regul to realli make sure that that reflect the most current scienc mr murray what are the thing most concern to you in the american diet mr califf the dietari pattern a lot of it is tie to socioeconom where you have so call food desert where peopl can t even get to a place that ha gener healthi food and it worri me a lot that there seem to be an invers relationship between the price of food and it nutrit valu that is the thing that are best for u tend to be more expens so poor peopl are eat much wors diet mr murray there s a lot of debat about calori and the qualiti of calori a lot of peopl say if you eat calori of salad that s prefer to calori of twinki ms mayn calori are import and fda ha done mani thing to tri to make thi realli clear the first is the updat to the nutrit fact label where calori will be display much more promin along with serv size inform other chang includ menu label which come to u through the afford care act where now menu will have to display calori inform for chain restaur with or more locat mr murray isn t the evid that here in new york after mayor bloomberg introduc it peopl ate more that it had the opposit effect of what wa intend ms mayn there s research around thi a well and one of the thing studi have indic is if you onli give calori inform but don t tell peopl what a normal amount of calori is they have a hard time interpret it put calori on an entre didn t mean thing to peopl who didn t know what normal calori intak is so thi is be implement the
