hi there  we   re point nine capital a vc firm focused on saas and marketplaces  if you want to be kept informed of our new posts you can subscribe to our content newsletter or follow our medium channel after france  we   re continuing our tour of the different european saas landscapes with the nordics region         sweden  denmark  finland  norway and iceland  in an attempt to get a global picture of this ecosystem we   ve listed      saas and software startups from the nordic region that we have mapped and analysed through several data points the aim of this study is not to be exhaustive  nor to rank startups  but rather to describe the main characteristics of this ecosystem and to compare it with other european regions  if your saas company is not on the map please fill this form and we   ll add ythe most popular category is    developer tools         infrastructure    with     of the startups listed  followed by collaboration         productivity         and marketing          these   software categories account for more than     of the startups on our map the distribution is similar if we limit our list to the vc backed companies only when you look at the two graphs carefully you   ll notice that the finance category accounts for       in the first case  but this number drops to    for vc backed companies  why is that  don   t vcs like finance startups the reason is simple  we actually found many small local    invoicing   accounting    saas products  since the finance category highly depends on local laws and rules we found plenty of small startups that sell invoicing tools for swedish  finnish  norwegian or danish smbs  these startups might be very good local businesses but they are hard to scale and are not a vc darling  hence the big difference since we did a similar software category analysis for the french market  let   s compare them interestingly the overall distribution looks the same  in both regions the top three categories are developer tools  marketing and productivity and in both cases they take the lion   s share with more than     of the startups listed  following this triumvirate the other categories  hr  crm sales  bi analytics  finance  support     each represent between   and     of our sample a slight difference between scandinavia and france is where the    collaboration   productivity    category ranks  in scandinavia it ranks at the second spot while in france it   s at the third position  as a matter of fact there is a very live ecosystem of productivity saas in scandinavia with already plenty of acquisitions that occured such as podio by citrix  flowdock by ca  projectplace by planview and some big established players like m files in finland to conclude our analysis on software categorization here is the split between vertical and horizontal saas companies  as a reminder horizontal software is industry agnostic software while vertical software is software tailored for a specific industry  again if we compare these numbers to the french cloudscape we find very similar results two lessons now let   s analyse this landscape from a funding perspective first the average amount raised by the vc backed startups of our list is     m and the median value is     m  note that since we couldn   t access the funding data of every startup on our list we   ve limited our analysis to the companies for which we have data  ie we didn   t assume no funding announced   bootstrapped  again these results are quite similar to what we found for the french saas ecosystem with respectively     m and     m  it seems that at its current level of maturity the funding values of european saas players tend to gravitate around   m in median and   m on average when we compare the funding values between horizontal and vertical companies the numbers stay relatively close  the median value being higher for vertical saas and finally let   s have a look at the funding values by software category as a short conclusion to the first   lessons  it   s quite interesting to see that the french and scandinavian landscapes are very similar in terms of funding and software category distribution  it possibly hints at a similar saas market maturity in both regions  by european standards  as we   ve seen above  this scandinavian landscape shares a lot of similarities with the french cloudscape in terms of funding values and software categories  but if there   s an area where we could spot major differences it   s for sure on how internationalization is done for instance when we look at the companies that have moved their headquarters to the us we notice a big difference between france and scandinavia this graph shows that most vertical saas companies keep their headquarters in france while plenty of vertical scandinavian companies move their hq to the us to understand this difference we   ve studied the internationalization playbooks of several of these companies and what we found is that the promising french vertical saas generally first spend time dominating their home market and later expand internationally on a country basis  and most of the time within europe   very few of them move to the us early on  promising scandinavian vertical saas have a different playbook as they migrate to the us much faster a possible explanation can be found in their home market size and cultural differences sweden has a population of   m people  finland    m  denmark    m and norway  m  france has   m inhabitants  about     times the size of the total nordic population  in these conditions it makes less sense for an ambitious nordic startup to first dominate its home market  this is probably a major reason why these startups go to the us much faster  they cannot grow huge by staying at home so the best strategy is to target directly bigger markets like the us but the market size alone is not enough to explain this difference  it is also combined with major cultural aspects  otherwise we could expect this situation to happen in every small country   the scandinavian population tends to have a much more    international    mindset  the english spoken and written level is a good indicator as sweden  norway  denmark and finland are all ranked in the top   adult english proficiency rankings this international mindset can also be seen through their local ecosystems the scandinavian region has also real growing local ecosystems which can be analysed through their main tech hubs  startup mafias and vc firms tech hubs  when we looked at the locations of the headquarters it was clear that each country had its own tech hub where magic happens  copenhagen for denmark  stockholm for sweden and the espoo         helsinki area for finland  and when we spoke with locals it was clear that these ecosystems were growing as we heard the typical complaints in such situations  increasing rent prices and lots more competition for talent    it   s worth noting that norway and iceland are behind in terms of hub maturity but are improving fast startup mafia  another strong signal of a maturing ecosystem is the presence of startup mafias  by startup mafia we mean entrepreneurs who have previously worked in startups which were acquired   exited and who are launching their own startups after that  as we briefly mentioned above there has already been interesting acquisitions in the scandinavian software   saas scene and several scandinavian entrepreneurs are already onto their next venture  atomia  ex pingdom   peakon  ex podio   the skype mafia etc vcs  to fuel an ecosystem you need money and support  there are many firms based in the nordic regions which invest in software and saas companies like creandum  sweden   open ocean capital  finland   northzone  sweden   verdane capital  norway   frumtak  iceland   alliance venture  norway   nordic makers  atomico based in london but created by ex zype founder niklas zennstr  m etc    but local vc firms are not the only ones investing in nordic startups  many european firm are doing that too like point nine capital  index  balderton  idinvest etc    it   s worth noting that in the current state of the market investments are slowing down in scandinavia too another very interesting aspect is how the saas ecosystem is reflective of local industries for example we found several startups selling    pick and shovel    software for the gaming industry  like gameanalytics or unity in denmark   in iceland you   ll find software powering the fishing industry  fishing is one of the main economic drivers for iceland   in norway several startups provide tools for the energy sector  which the    industry in norway  etc in a typical    scratching your own itch    approach  many entrepreneurs launch companies to solve problems that big local companies experience which cloud companies are included in the list companies are cloud software  meaning they provide a software available in the cloud  no on premise or self hosted only products   this can be through a saas  an api or even open source if they also offer paid saas plans is this list of scandinavian cloud companies exhaustive hell no  i wish but it   s not the case  i   m really aware of the limitation of such a study but i believe that done is better than perfect  this list is a starting point  we   ll keep adding companies and update the graphs  if you spot companies which are missing please fill this form how did you build this list we first listed nordic cloud companies by exploring sources such as both manually and through apis then we enriched our data thanks to the startup databases mentioned above  crunchbase and angel list  and also with clearbit and linkedin one thing i can say for sure is that there is no silver bullet and no source is self sufficient  for example we found many interesting scandinavian companies not listed on crunchbase  or with missing information  where can i see the list and its data here can you tell me a little more about the data available for each startup startup name   url   crunchbase link  self explanatoritype  can be either horizontal or vertcategory  macro software categoricurrently we have a short note on software categories  first there is no perfect categorization  i tried to stick to what other firms like bessemer or emergence have done but i also simplified some categories like the    developers    one which contains subcategories like developer tools  apis  infrastructure etc  or bundled marketing and sales together second for each startup i chose the category myself  i   ve checked the     companies listed and decided to which category they belong  sometimes it   s clear and sometimes the line between two categories can be blurry for a tool  so i   m well aware that it might be subjective in some cases and i   m more than open to discuss changes industry  the industry in case of a vertical softwartags
