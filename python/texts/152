the first two laws of human centered design are    know thy user    and    thou art not thy user     taking those laws to heart  i decided the best place to start would be calling some friends that use medium  specifically on ios  after six    minute informal interviews with friends about their experience with the medium app  a few things bubbled to the surface well  that makes sense  medium does one thing extremely well         it provides a platform for amazing content to make its way to interested readers so instead of improving the app for myself  i came up with a blended persona of the people i interviewed to guide my thinking throughout this process   based on that minimal qualitative research  improving user engagement with content seemed like an interesting direction to go  but what purpose does improving engagement serve  well  content is at the core of everything medium does  the more that users engage with content  the more that medium can leverage that to its benefit as a business with engagement as my true north for this exploration  i would need to find a way to provide users with medium content that is the most relevant to them  some kpis  key performance indicators  that might reflect this direction are kpis that i wouldn   t track because they don   t provide as much value  i   ll be using the royal    we    here after a brief review of the possible solutions  i   ve chosen the best options that work best in this specific situation medium meets tinder      you only get   a day  and it says a lot about what content you are into if medium wanted to show this super recommend publicly  it could give a user insight into how many other users were willing to recommend this story over anything else that day  something like   this would give skyler a second dimension of information with which to decide if he wants to read it or bookmark it for later if medium wanted to keep super recommend data private  it could be used to create a tighter data profile on users  so they can have fewer and better recommendations on their homepage medium recommendations are the love child of twitter   s favorite   retweet button  though elegant and simple  it   s hard to decouple enjoying a story from wanting to promote it  when users are encouraged to be discerning with recommending content  it gives readers more confidence in opening the curated content that appears on their homepage in addition to the    top highlight     it would be nice to have different shades of green highlights showing which parts were highlighted with what frequency  so skyler would know how often parts were found to be invaluable this would minimize    buyer   s remorse    when starting a long article  this also asks for the least change of behavior from skyler and the medium community the highlighting tool that exists right now is already pretty sweet  i was initially thinking about how we might get users to highlight more often  this ended up not being the right question  asking users to highlight more stuff is asking them to lower their standards of what they think is quality material  which grinds against what i believe medium is trying to create         a space where high quality content is applauded and organically distributed right now  there   s no interface to share medium stories with specific medium users  but the homepage is an interface to see those stories         it   s just that it hasn   t been implemented yet  intuitively  when i think about who could recommend the best content to me  it would be people that know me personally in my experience  recommending doesn   t feel like i   m recommending to my followers  but more like just recommending in general to boost the popularity of a story  it would be awesome if the    for you    tab on the home screen included stories that my friends had specifically shared with me i would have to a b test these improvements individually to see which ones performed best against the kpis i defined  determining if a success metric is statistically relevant can only be done once i know how a feature moves the needle on the kpis of course  were i part of the medium team  my approach would be informed by data and knowledge of the avenues that have already been explored  medium is doing so many things right  and this was my humble offering of how i might contribute to that trend product manager   designer   hovercards  instant logos    previously  capitalon
