robert kraft is one of my personal heroes  for a rhode island kid growing up in the shadow of the perennially pathetic new england patriots  he   s the savior that showed up  cleaned house  built a world class organization  and delivered the greatest franchise the sport has ever known  with character and faith  he and his family persevered in the face of withering townie cynicism  achieving on  and off field triumphs no self respecting masshole could have dreamt of back in       and he did it all with style and grace  a firm hand and a human touch  a husband  father  and citizen that set an example for us all in      i had the opportunity to work closely with robert and jonathan kraft on a startup called matchmine  the project was ill fated for reasons worthy of another blog post  but it gave me a chance to get to know these men on a personal basis  it was something i couldn   t pass up early in our relationship  at robert   s tidy and tasteful home in chestnut hill  we hunkered down in his study one night to get to know each other  we moved quickly past the pleasantries  talking about business and life  just a couple of football fans who played some ivy league ball back in the day  wiser and wider after some mellowing in the real world  we talked about family and faith         the only things more important to him than football         about the common threads of italian and jewish culture     mediterraneans     he called us      and the demands and joys of fatherhood  it was wonderful  and after a while i began to relax and he began to accept me into the tribe    there   s something i   d like to ask you     i said  after working up the courage    shoot     he said    i   ve had some success  robert  and known many people who were successful  but i   ve only known a few folks as successful as you  now we   re sitting here  just a couple old lineman  shooting the shit about gino cappelletti  it   s great  but i guess i just expected you to be    different  as a kid from the burbs  there   s something i always wondered about people who were able to succeed at your level       ok  what       well    we both come from families and traditions that value relationships  and it   s obvious we both look at business through that lens  i guess what i   m wondering as we sit here is whether that philosophy holds up at your level  i mean    if you want to be a billionaire  if you really want to reach the top    do you have to come to terms with the need to be         well         a dick sometimes    he looked away for just a moment  reflecting on the question     i hope not     he said  turning back to me    people are people     he continued     and the same dynamics are at play at any level of business  it   s hard sometimes  you have to make hard choices to win  but i don   t think you need to be a dick  doing right by people is a good strategy because  in the long run  good business is personal       but you have to play hardball sometimes     i pressed     right  i know you   ve found yourselves in situations where your personal loyalties were in conflict with what the team needed to do  look at the situation with drew  bledsoe   cutting him must have been hard  even though going with tom  brady  set up all the success that followed       that   s true     he said     but i don   t think i was a dick about it  i felt a personal debt to drew  who was a great guy and had been the face of our organization for many years  when it was time for him to move on  we worked to do the right thing for him  in the end we traded him to a big afc rival  which was clearly not in the interests of our team  but we knew it was the right thing for drew  and that   s why we made that deal happen       i guess there are relationship people  and there are transaction people     he said  digging deeper into his own thoughts     in business you need to deal with both  but i   ve always tried to be a relationship person  i don   t know if that   s always the better way  you leave something on the table sometimes  but things are going pretty good so far  so i   m sticking with it    a year or so later  as the credit crunch took hold of the economy in       we shut that business down  we did it despite having achieved all the milestones we set for ourselves at the beginning  and i   d be lying if i said it didn   t upset me at the time  it was one of the hardest things i   ve ever had to do  but it helped to have robert and jonathan   s personal support throughout we did what we could to take care of people  to help get them into jobs elsewhere and move on  i   m proud of the way that team came together  actually  networking and supporting each other in the search for new opportunities  we met socially  created a group thread to share who was hiring  and kept in touch as each person  inevitably  landed successfully someplace new  many went on to great success at other companies  and remain friends to this day as netflix put it so beautifully a while back  a business is not a family  in the end  but a team  a pro team  in fact  but a team that can look out for each other even when the game is over companies come and go in our business  and to lead one you need to come to terms with hard choices that will effect the lives of people you care about  the solution isn   t not to care  though  it   s to reconcile what is necessary for the business with what is right for the people  and to apply yourself equally in service to both that   s how it works in the pros  according to one of the best ever
