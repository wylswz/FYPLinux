mongolia has fascinated me for a long time  i love its immense green steppes  wild horses  and friendly white yurts  its history of the empire of genghis khan  the traditional costumes reminiscent of japanese samurai culture and of course  the very essence of the country  its nomadic culture living far from the madness of cities  without attachment to a specific place  and being able to pick up and leave overnight  is this not true freedom trapped by our sedentary lives  it is hard to imagine that this way of life is still possible today  our adventure at the heart of a mongolian family granted us some very rewarding answers  but not necessarily those we expected we left at the beginning of september with the excellent german photographer  max muench  for the disconnect collection of fotolia by adobe the flight over the capital  ulan bator  displayed the cultural and historic past of mongolia  between russia and china  this immense country of boundless steppes was  long ago  the largest empire of all time today  trapped between modernity and tradition  the country is in crisis  half of its         inhabitants live as nomads  some went to live in cities with the hope of a better life  others returned to live like their ancestors and left the ghettos of the capital  disappointed by the egotism of this society  it was necessary to return to the land the family we stayed with for a week had clearly made its choice  the steppes  it must have taken at least    hours to get to their home in one of the most remote parts of mongolia  it was more an epic journey than a trip our first meeting with zula and his family was epic this simple ritual had the benefit of instantly warming the body and loosening our tongues  note that we had a choice         we just risked offending our hosts right at the beginning in the morning  the first step  somewhat shaky  outside the yurt left us speechless  the fog dissipated slowly  nature awoke      zula  in t shirt on his bike  despite the poor degree above zero  was already at work since the first light  winteriscoming  time is of the essence  winter will be long and harsh here  wealth is counted not in money or goods  but in the number of animals acquired during various trades or inheritances  as an example  there are more horses than people in mongolia the sheep  yaks  and cows are the lifeblood of the nomads  they use the animals    hides to stay warm  their meat and milk to feed themselves  and they ride the horses and camels within the family  everyone does what they can to help  the children herd the animals  the older people milk them and then process the milk for storage and transportation the milk is used to make cheese  fermented milk  milk fat  and a kind of goat milk vodka using knowledge passed down from generation to generation  in this way  they can gain the maximum benefit from each animal and survive under extremely harsh conditions the challenge is to do all of this while respecting this environment that provides the necessities for survival  this means not polluting the rivers that quench the thirst of both people and animals  and not destroying the forests that warm them  all of this requires an understanding of the natural world surrounding them many people think that the mongolian nomads avoid technology and modernity  this is clearly a common misconception despite their very simple and traditional way of life  they have borrowed several conveniences from the modern world  a solar panel powers a battery that lights the yurt when night comes  an emergency phone attached to a post symbolizes the single link with the rest of the world  cobbled together motorbikes from the soviet era transport them at night  without headlights  through the shadows of the mongol steppes and a van allows them to transport wood and hay to warm themselves and feed the animals this blend of the modern and the traditional is not without its charms  i remember in particular  this time when zula came to our yurt to drop off a goat   s head  freshly killed  in our yurt  between the drums of fermenting milk and the drying goat stomachs for good luck this close link that connects the family to the modern world also shows up once a month when baata  zula   s wife  goes back to karakorum  the former capital of mongolia  to trade a bit of cheese and meat for vegetables to round out their meals and gas to fuel their vehicles as more proof of their modernity  the mongols are well educated  zula and baata were born into a nomad family and like many children  they went to school in the city when they were    years old zula stayed there until he was    years old  he first earned a degree in economics before becoming a ranger  taking care of the forests and animals  the call of the wild was too strong for him and so he returned to his nomadic life  today  just as he did  his children stay at a boarding school during the week  despite the seemingly endless journey that separates them from the city this experience is essential in mongolian culture  as it enables the children to make their own decision about what they would like to do later in life  stay in the city and try to make something of themselves in a modern society in crisis or return to nature i admit that for a person in their twenties  this is a no win situation  mongolia suffers from a high rate of unemployment  which is even worse during the winter  in the city  you can find a dynamic youth scene that only has to worry about pollution and unemployment  they crowd the bars and share everything through social networks  yes  just like we do   talk to them about abandoning this life to end up    isolated    on the steppes and they will laugh in your face at the same time  we can see how it is not so easy to imagine yourself spending the winter in a yurt  when temperatures can reach       c  completely cut off from the world  without even seeing the rest of the world for months as incredible as it may seem  the nomads do not cross long distances that often  in my mind  i imagined that they changed locations each year  traveling hundreds of kilometers  but no  when they find a good spot for their livestock  they settle down just like that if nomads move regularly  it is for a single  simple  good reason  the grazing  the animals must always have something to eat  and so  as the seasons move on  the nomads go farther and farther until they reach their winter camp here  they live in harmony with nature  taking advantage of its blessings  but also subject to the threats that lurk around them  during our stay  two sheep and a goat were killed by wolves  zula  as a former ranger  does not hesitate to track them to preserve his resources what looks like a game when he shows us his sniper skills is  in fact  a constant hunt and an invisible pressure that hovers over every night on the plateau although isolated  the nomads are not alone  they all know each other and help each other out  they don   t hesitate to spend a day working to help a nearby family harvest hay for the winter  a day repaid with the loan of a tractor that will save zula and his wife several days of hard labor  it is a fair trade finally  what appears to us to be survival is just life  the tasks are simple and varied  difficult but gratifying  as with our trip to the philippines for disconnect  we felt reconnected and conscious of the delicate balance that governs our world often  when my friends and i are discussing the problems of our modern world  we reach the same conclusion         we are too attached to our belongings our society pushes to maintain the borders that clearly define our country  we put ourselves into debt for life in order to own a home that we will have a hard time leaving despite its problems  we become addicted and totally dependent on small  everyday objects while forgetting what is truly important  we refuse to make choices in life out of fear of losing benefits  we follow rules imposed by a system that we are always criticizing yes  i know  it   s a bleak picture  i am deliberately exaggerating as  even if i tend to stay optimistic and always try to get more out of life  i  myself  am the worst example in order to fight against this system that is eating me alive  i travel farther and farther  it is the only thing that gives me a real feeling of freedom  but even then  i admit that i love coming back home and rediscovering the joys of my comfort zone there  where the nomadic culture made such an impression on me  this idea is applied on a constant basis  i remain convinced that it is the key to living a fulfilled life  when i was writing this article  i found this study conducted at the cornell university that completely agreed with me nor should we lie about it  the nomadic life is difficult  while it is by default for some and by desire for others  it is for the most part out of frustration that many mongols return to the nomadic life  the precarious conditions of life in the city and the very high rate of unemployment lead many families to leave the ghettos of ulan bator to return to a simple life it   s funny  but when i ask my friends where their ideal place to live was  the most common answer was     different places in the world depending on the season    personally  when i think about my future as an    independent designer     this is exactly what i would like to do  i am lucky enough to be in a profession that allows me to work anywhere in the world  so why not meanwhile  i decided to rejoin genghis khan   s army i wrote this article with my  bro  axel who also handles the voice and music of our videos at what the film note that you can purchase most of the photos max m  ench presented in this article by visiting here  almost    photos  and    videos we produced  all in hd remember that the three other series with sonia szostak  brice portolano and th  o gosselin are still available on
