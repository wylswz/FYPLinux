original interview  http   www techiesproject com dan miller so tell me about your early years and where you come from i was born in a small suburb in new jersey  in central jersey  a town called flemington   near princeton  it   s about an hour and twenty minutes from new york  and an hour on the dot to philadelphia  nice little suburban oasis  i suppose  in new jersey  where like you know  all of our parents worked in one of those cities and that was kind of it  it was extremely homogenous  i   ll make sure that that   s known   laughter  and to give you a sense of to what degree  i went to a high school of about       my graduating class was      and in that class of     there were ten african americans  male and female wow but  i grew up in close proximity to massive cities that had tons of culture  so it never felt         i don   t know  the lifestyle wasn   t as representative as you might think from those numbers  it was pretty urban  as much as it could be from a culture and lifestyle standpoint that   s interesting it was a lot of fun when did you first get interested in tech i think elementary school  i have a great aunt and uncle that live in my hometown  and my uncle worked for at t  as early as i can remember  we had a computer at the house  like most people my age  i was the reason that we got aol in the house  chuckles   it was always very close and accessible for me  i was super curious because i had never seen anything like that in terms of a physical computer  elementary school had a computer class  i   m thinking first or second grade  and we   d just play oregon trail and things like that  from an accessibility standpoint  i think it was elementary school and that led me to programming my own role play game in the ti    when i was in sixth or seventh grade  there was a whole other world out there that i wanted to see  and there was access to it through the internet and that was         and still is to some degree         the allure to me that   s amazing  i can   t even imagine  i didn   t know tech existed until i was     laughter   describe your experience actually getting into tech  then starting your own company i went to school for economics  so growing up close to new york city  at least in my town  the majority of kids are prone to either go into business or finance  definitely during the late   s and early   s  things were going very very well from an economical standpoint so a lot of people were drawn to that industry  i finished college in      and worked on wall street for less than    days  laughter   i knew that it wasn   t for me  it just wasn   t what i wanted to spend the majority of my time doing  thankfully  a sales job opened up at a startup called theladders com  the job market was tough  so i said yes to the position and did b c sales for about a year  then transitioned over into operations   and that was my first job within tech  things started to not go so well at the ladders a couple of years later  and i saw it coming  one of my co workers left and moved out to san francisco to work for surveymonkey  he sent me over to the job opportunities site and said     hey  if there   s anything you   re interested in  let me know     there was  and before i knew it  i had put my life in three bags and i was flying across the country to live in san francisco  a city that i had never visited before in my life  laughter   but i was twenty five at the time and i was like fuck it  i   ll take this risk  i was feeling complacent in new york anyway how did your family feel about you just up and going i   ve always been that way         free  self sustaining  i   m sure they thought    this is just what danny   s doing now     i always make my own decisions  and i   ve always been independent in that sense  so there was nothing they could really say  i was going to go regardless okay  so you got to san francisco  you   d never been yeah what was it like when you first got here honestly  it was great  i had a really  really positive experience  the same friend that referred me for the job         i moved in with him  we lived in pac heights  right off of clay and gough  and i lived in prospect heights in brooklyn in new york  so i moved from brooklyn to essentially the upper east side  which was interesting  it was so new  i was in the honeymoon phase  and visually nothing that i was seeing in terms of the topography and all the parks was comparable to anything i had seen in new york or on the east coast  so it was amazing to me when i first moved out how were your early years working at startups  before you became an entrepreneur you know  i think they were net positive in terms of   there was definitely a learning curve  a pretty significant learning curve because    how big was surveymonkey when you joined    yeah  still pretty small super small  yeah  but as it pertains to         i don   t know  this might sound a little crazy but the tech companies that were in new york at the time  weren   t doing amazing work  in my opinion  and surveymonkey was great  because it was product focused  theladders had a large sales force  we had like     sales people trying to make money for the company  and surveymonkey was my first time being exposed to extremely amazing senior leadership  and everyone was so bright  energetic  and passionate about what they were working on  which was an amazing experience for me in that the first bay area company that i got to work for  was this amazing company  but for me  i chose to spend a lot of time outside of work learning  so i could be competitive in the workplace  and it was amazing because they had speakers come in like sheryl sandberg and eric reese  and that   s definitely not common  laughter   having access to that type of tutelage from those types of folks was amazing  and being able to read things like the lean startup helped me learn what the business was like at a product focused company  that was good what was the impetus for you deciding to go from employee to entrepreneur  it   s such a major jump yeah  i think the impetus was that i had launched a t shirt line in college  we   ll have to go back a little bit  that was my senior year of college  and during that business  myself and my cofounders recorded a mixtape to cross promote the t shirt launch  laughter   we were recording this mixtape and   i wish more people did that  laughter so my other friends  they had gone to school for music management and they knew the business         they had a record label  they had artists that they were managing  and they had recording studios  that was my first introduction to studios and studio operations  et cetera  i   ve been a lifelong musician and i loved it and    what did you play i play the alto saxophone nice yeah  because of bill clinton  laughter  oh man actually i think it was arsenio hall at the time anyway  after we recorded this mixtape  i moved to brooklyn  but i wanted to continue to either write songs or record a little bit and the process of finding a studio is just ridiculously difficult  and there   s just tons of friction from the artist side to the studio owners  and at the same time i used this service called zocdoc  which is a site that allows anyone to book their next doctor   s appointment  i figured there should be something like that for musicians  but at the time i had no idea what i needed to do to build a company  let alone a tech company or something that would connect musicians with studio owners  so  that was the driving force behind my startup fast forward to when i was at surveymonkey         so about   and a half years later         i had reached a kind of glass ceiling i   d say  within surveymonkey  i wanted to get into writing my own research  and that was not in their business model at the time  so  you were either an engineer or owned products or business intelligence or sales  and that was kind of it at the time what year was that        so i knew that i was looking for something else  luckily i found a position at forrester research  which kind of offered me that  so i was able to work with clients as a consultant and write my own research  that was nice  i was there for about six months  and got poached by salesforce to do the same exact thing  just internally  and i hope i   m not infringing on my safe harbor  laughter   so i went to salesforce and did exactly that  just internally  it was myself and my boss and we helped manage all of the internal and external market research  which was awesome and a dream job  but i had been quietly working on my startup that entire time  about six months  seven months into sales force  it got to a point where the most important input into the startup         freshsessions         was my time  things were increasingly         well  my time was increasingly getting marginalized because the gig at salesforce was a very demanding position so you were running both at the same time yes  it was crazy  we had just raised a little bit of money from some friends and family and i had a little bit of an exit  so i had some money from working at surveymonkey  luckily at the time i was dating a girl who was also an entrepreneur and she just kind of told me to take the plunge  so that was the inspiration  that was the impetus and how that happened walk me through what it   s like to take the plunge into entrepreneurship and the struggles involved  the amazing parts and the bad parts i think the analogy of jumping out of an airplane and pulling your chute and hoping that it opens is completely accurate  because you   re not trained for the things that you   re going to encompass in trying to launch something  all of a sudden you have this free time  you have no manager   laughter  you don   t have co workers  so you have to adjust  if you were someone that worked independently or in a field where you were making your own decisions  i think that it becomes more comfortable for those types of folks  but i didn   t work in industries or companies like that  for me i had to figure it out while i was in the air  i had to learn how assemble my own parachute  it was interesting because my other two co founders were still in new york  so i was managing that relationship and all of a sudden my friends went from people that we would just go out and have beers with with and talk about dumb stuff to people that had to inspire and manage  we were inspired to work towards a common goal  so  what i did was spend time reading  i asked all my friends that were in mba programs what they were learning  what books they were reading  and asked for all the materials i could get from them  and had a little staycation that didn   t end  chuckles   i just started reading  and that   s been part of my process up until now  honestly  i   ll have to think a little bit more on some specific stories  but the challenges were  for sure  managing friends that now were co founders  right  but also like figuring out     who   s building this     we had some talent gaps  we had to find contractors to build some front end work for us seems just like a daily battle  but exhilarating yeah  for sure  you figure out how to manage it  and what to focus on  but at the time  you   re just so overwhelmed and you   re trying to like bring in so much information  and you   re reading every article on inc  techcrunch  or whatever  and not knowing what to spend your precious attention and energy on  was a huge challenge  and that took me like two years to learn   chuckle  honestly related to learning and soaking in all that knowledge  have you had mentors or people that you   ve looked up to for inspiration along the way yes  but i think the most important source of inspiration has been my other contemporaries         like other friends i have         that have launched companies and learning from them  even if they have launched a company that was six months ahead of mine  or a year ahead of mine         they still have so much information that could help me save time         most importantly         and money  and help me navigate the landscape more thoughtfully i don   t have an official mentor that i check in with consistently  i did have advisors for that first company  so i would check in with them on a monthly basis  but that was it where did you build your support network of other entrepreneurs events  just getting out and showing face  undoubtedly  you bump into people that are really either interested in you  or what you   re building  or you just connect on a personal level  and those relationships are extremely important when you   re trying to do something that either has never been done before  or you   re doing something that you   ve never done before and having that support system and people that can relate and either buy into your vision  or offer some feedback is extremely important yeah  where do you think your risk appetite came from  like  where do you think your motivation comes from  because not everyone has that  you know yeah  i think it   s twofold  i   ve been a lifelong athlete  and i think competition is just in me  but in a healthy way  like i don   t need to be competitive in all aspects of my life    like the game is fun yeah  for sure  for me it   s fun to exercise that  because it   s been a part of me since i was five  the second piece is that  although i grew up in a nice area  my family   s not extremely well off  and things were good when i was growing up         as the oldest         and i was given a lot of opportunity  and i   ve taken that duty         i guess that opportunity  that access to opportunity as a duty to do as much as i can  take it to the zenith  and try to support my entire family         certainly my immediate family but if i can  cousins  uncles  aunts  etc  so that   s what motivates me  and i   ve been gifted in a lot of things  i   ve figured out how to navigate a lot of different landscapes  so i   ve been successful in a lot of different areas  and i think if i   m able to leverage that to help a lot of other people  then i   ll do so how do your friends and family feel about the work that you   ve done and where you are now  all the way on the other coast yeah  yeah  so they   re certainly sad that i   m all the way in california  i see them maybe three times a year now  but  i think they   re blown away by what i   m doing  which is amazing  i think that   s definitely something i   ve been conscious of  but i don   t think they fully understand the path that i   ve chosen to walk down or folks like me that i   ve chosen to walk down  my aunt was a teacher  my mom works in a bank  my dad   s a teacher  it   s not the same  so i don   t think they fully comprehend  but i try to bring them up to speed as much as possible and stay in touch as much as possible so they can get more of a glimpse into what   s happening so tell me about what you   re working on now yeah  so i recently launched a mobile tele health app called level  that provides access to psychotherapists  so through our mobile app you can have a session with one of our therapist  the inspiration came back in march or april of       when i used one of our competitors and had a terrible experience         with the service as well as the therapist         that left me feeling like a number  at the time there was a lot of chaos going on in my life and i just needed to figure out how to get to some sort of baseline so i could manage it all  after having that negative experience  i walked away thinking i could build something better  i started doing some research about the industry  what kind of barriers existed  what would work with the current legislative landscape  etc  and it seemed to be a pretty smart time to start a business like ours  so i went out  assembled a team  we have a licensed therapist on our team  and an amazing cto  starting in august we   ve just been churning away and started seeing patients a couple weeks ago do you have a lot of clientele in tech oh yeah i feel like mental health is such an issue and so stigmatized for entrepreneurs yeah  you hit the nail on the head  that   s what was going on in my life in early       i was feeling pretty depressed and definitely experiencing acute symptoms of anxiety  the first start up wasn   t going so well and managing that along with life in general was doing damage that i could not see until it affecting my everyday life  i was trying to do too much and brute force something that wasn   t working and i should have known to fold a little earlier  but through trying to brute force a business back to life  i started to experience symptoms of different mental health disorders  i suppose  i believe a lot of entrepreneurs take the plunge because they have a safety net  and or an abnormally high tolerance for risk  for me  it was the latter  i think this tolerance for risk stemmed from being able to survive         often thrive         in most circumstances life had thrown my way up to that point  malcolm gladwell would probably describe me as a    remote miss    in his book david and goliath  this   survivors exhilaration  i believe  is what was driving me to continue to push the business forward  while things         around me were unraveling  and i don   t think that   s uncommon in the valley  i think there are a lot of entrepreneurs that are feeling the same way  this is certainly something entrepreneurs should be conscious of yeah  i still feel this way  where we   re all pressured to have our peer face on and be like     everything is great  everybody   s great  i   m great  look at my instagram  look how good my life is  look at my lifestyle     i think it creates a lot of people who feel lonely yeah  i can see that it   s like everybody   s pretending but how do you manage that  because you   re the face of a company  so when the face of the company is so close to what you   re actually experiencing because it   s the same person  what parts do you show  right yeah  knowing that people have so much access to you yeah  i don   t know the answer yeah  i think some people just either get off the grid  right  they   re not on twitter  they   re not on instagram yeah right  and they don   t do events  things along those lines  and they just kind of pop up with products yeah but yeah  i don   t know what the answer is in a similar vein  what has been kind of the hardest or lowest points for you in this whole tech journey  it might be work related  it might be personal definitely it was personal so my ex girlfriend that kind of like gave me this inspiration to take this plunge         it   s interesting because that part of my life was progressing pretty quickly  and the first start up was great and going well  reasonably well   but for about the last six months of the business  it was certainly not going well  and figuring out how to be a good partner and not bring pretty stressful work circumstances into the house was hard to manage  and i didn   t manage it well  if i did at all  so that was a part of it  but i think ultimately just managing when things aren   t going well and knowing when to fold  and knowing how to manage a decline because there are things more important  like family and relationships yeah  well  having gone through that myself  it   s like when your work is your life and it   s your baby  and your heart  and your soul  and it   s going really hard  how do you separate yourself  i don   t know if you can i don   t think you can either how do you not bring that home because you are your start up exactly  yeah  i think you try to figure out how to communicate through it  and that   s probably the largest lesson i learned  how to clearly  objectively communicate         not communicating to prove a point  but to gain understanding and share information the right way  and  yeah that   s been valuable for me not only in my personal life  but professional as well yeah  it   s so nice to have a support network of people who get you  who understand why you   re an entrepreneur because they   re similar  i   m personally very grateful for friends who understand why i would do a hundred interviews  laughter  for some random project in addition to my own work if you don   t  what else do we have  i   m sure you feel this way         i don   t want to speak for you  but i feel this way         if this is something that came into your head and you figured out a plan on how to do it and you think it   s a worth while cause  do it  to not to is like   exactly  you just got to do it how do you feel about the state of tech in       you   ve been in it for a little while and you   ve seen change         what are you pumped about and what are you frustrated with i am pumped that there is a huge push into increasing accessibility to different groups of people  i won   t even say minorities  i think it   s just people in general  not only from the standpoint of getting access into jobs at certain companies  but learning different skills  or even having internet for the first time in their lives         when you start to think internationally  i think that is going to breed amazing opportunities  products  and services that are not only useful  but are just really really cool because so many different types of people have access to the tools to create things  so that   s what i   m most excited about  and i   m excited that there are a lot of companies that operate on massive scales to actually make an impact         like facebook or google for  example  what i   m most frustrated with is         i think it   s a product of people being able to quickly create products or solve problems         but i don   t think people are working on great things  and maybe that   s some kind of bourgeois comment  but i see a lot of bs companies getting getting worked on  this is valuable time  i would much rather spend time thinking a little bit more and working on something that impacts people   s lives versus the next sophomoric uber for x app  there actually is an uber for puppies going around  yes  people love puppies  but at the same time  spending a little bit more time in trying to create something that increases a lot of value or injects a lot of value into people   s lives is far more worthwhile to me are there any companies that you   re really excited about who are doing meaningful work i think good eggs is a great example  i know they just had to lay off a decent amount of folks  but increasing access to sustainable foods  and employing a lot of people in the process  is pretty cool to me and i think they did a good job from a branding perspective as well  the whole package is pretty cool what are some of the biggest lessons you   ve learned while you have worked in tech ask     why    and this is         i   m just really interested in getting to the root of things  and the more that you ask     why        the less time there is for the opportunity there is from miscommunication and i   ve already mentioned i   m pretty big on communication now secondly  act fast and ask for forgiveness not for permission lastly         this is a life motto         find your passion and inspire  i believe fulfillment is inevitable with this motto in mind  that has certainly been true for me  i   ve always had a passion for helping people and i think that is what led me to launch this second company yeah  i love that  i love that both of your projects are autobiographical in a way you know it   s like    yeah  they are     it   s like you   ve created something essentially for yourself  like to resolve a problem within yourself and so like you   re kind of your own primary case study  i just feel like  i wouldn   t do this project if it didn   t have something to do with me  i just feel like the really high quality work comes from personal experience absolutely i agree where do you see yourself in five or ten years  do you think you   ll still be here  you seem to love san francisco i like san francisco  no  i do  i love san francisco but i can   t spend all of my time here  i just know what it is and i love it for what it is  but at the same time it leaves me yearning for things that it   s not         and instead of speaking in the abstract         and it leaves me yearning for diversity in my day to day life  not just racially but socio economically as well  although i love the area and all that it can offer in a three hour radius and all the amazing things that i can do  there are very few places in the world that you can have access to that type of stuff  those types of opportunities  i   d like to have a home here  but probably not stay here year round  so then i start to think about where else i might go and i don   t think there   s anywhere else in the us  i   ve done new york  i love new york me too but i   m not ready to get back yet  europe i think is probably next i totally understand where you   re coming from  in this project even i feel very prompted to just talk about how it   s not just a problem of recruiting  it   s a problem of keeping  in terms of diverse folks  it   s not just the pipeline problem  it   s that people come  and then they leave because it doesn   t feel quite right and i don   t know what the solution is  but i just feel like it   s worth talking about you   re right  i think it   s certainly changing because         i was vocal about this when i first moved here  just having access to the lifestyle i had when i lived in new york took a long while to find  when i moved here there weren   t bars that played amazing music  a lot of the bars  if they played music  it was super corny  laughter  new york restaurant music is astronomically better and people don   t dance here  well  they do now  but not as much  exactly  you know  laughter   but i think people are recognizing that and there are amazing companies like toasted life  for example  which some of my friends own  that cater to black millennials  and they put on awesome events at venues in the bay area  and they play awesome music  the more that people do things like that  the more palatable living in san francisco will be for people moving from other cities and countries one of my favorite things about new york         i lived there  just for a little bit  every time i go back there  it definitely feels more culturally vibrant and diverse  but there   s more equalizers  like the subway  everybody rides the subway  everybody eats dollar slices of pizza late at night  everybody gets bagels  i just feel like the lifestyles converge  of everyone  at certain points  i still use public transportation here  because i live next to a bart station  but i don   t feel like there are those unplanned collisions in the same way here not at all  where would they be  you know what advice would you give to folks from similar backgrounds to yours and similar perspectives to yours who are hoping to get into tech  or in tech now and are struggling i think         and i   m speaking from experience because this has helped me         i think dedicating yourself to learning helps you dedicate yourself towards growth  the only way that you achieve growth         in my opinion         consciously is through consistent effort to learn new things and step outside of your comfort zone  so i would recommend folks that are trying to get into tech to definitely try to learn as much as possible  but also step outside of their comfort zone often because again  that   s where the growth is  and this is a place where you   re consistently expected to create things that don   t exist yet  so you   re going to need to figure out how to be comfortable in that space because it   s not a comfortable space initially so         if you   re currently in tech         i recommend to work on worthwhile problems  don   t waste your time at a company or working on a project that you don   t believe in  clearly  there   s some leeway there  right  but ultimately if you can align yourself with a company that has similar values as you  then you can be confident in the majority of the work         or the net of the work         that you do is going to be positive and be in the same direction that you would already be going  i think  again  that that breeds quality  but i also think it breeds happiness because you   re working on problems you care about and it increases the likelihood you   re going to ultimately end up fulfilled   versus going to some other company and hitting the same type of keyboard  but working on something you don   t believe in  and in two or three years you   re not going to feel fulfilled about how you used your time  and your time is very  very
