i passed out yesterday  we were at a ping pong place and i was talking to a friend of mine when i simply fell to the ground and went unconscious we were in the middle of a conversation about health  he   s a physical trainer  and i said something like     i   m in the best health of my life    boom then all i remember is vaguely trying to hold onto something  then the next thing i know  i   ve been unconscious for two minutes and people are standing around me asking me if i   m ok i don   t know what was wrong  maybe i was dehydrated or something but i thought to myself  man  this would be a great way to die  i wasn   t aware of anything  no pain then i thought  every time i counted something in my life  was a total waste of my life  all those moments of counting and ranking add up  your likes add up to nothing when you are dead i   ll look at twitter followers  or money in bank  did it go up or down  or instagram likes  or amazon ranks  or how many times did she say     i love you    we   re primates so we always put ourselves in a tribe  a tribe is measured from alpha to omega  counting humans have a huge benefit  we select which tribe we can go into will we go into a corporate job  measured by job title and salary   will we be pro baseball players   measured by home runs or stolen bases   will we be entrepreneurs  measured by sales or growth or whatever  i played one game of ping pong after i passed out  it was against a much better player  thanks noah kagan   so i was happy to lose but only by four points           noah said     uh oh  you   re going to talk s  t about this forever  aren   t you    yes  i am but still           numbers voting  liking  loving  favoriting  selling  all numbers the essence of reinvention is not that that you change from one thing to another reinvention is when you go from doing something disconnected from your true self  to doing something closer to what aligns with the deepest part of you when you can do that   counting stops  that   s why we always need to reinvent you can   t    think    of what that is  you just have to do it  you won   t know until you get there  persistence   love   reinvention when i don   t need to count or rank myself  that   s the arrow that shows me i am going in the right direction the less i count today  the happier i will be  the less i depend on what others count  i will be happier  count on it related reading  what   s the point of liffor some reason  i   ve turned myself inside out and all my guts have spilled onto my blog  one day i   ll run out of stuff but not yet  http   bit ly  blmiag
