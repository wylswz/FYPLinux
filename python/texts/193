reflection on         in the courtyesterday          i had the fortunate opportunity to watch the decision to reverse the texas house bill   law released by the supreme court  a year ago  as a graduating high school senior  i never could have imagined sitting in the supreme court  let alone for an issue regarding abortion as i have continued my education  i have found a deep passion for education and learning in depth about as many issues as possible  over the course of the past two years  i have found myself gravitating towards women   s rights organizations  despite my previously proclaimed lack of interest for such issues  during the spring of my senior year of high school  i worked at a domestic violence agency  the second step  which supports survivors in recreating sustainable lifestyles for themselves and their children  this summer  i applied for machon kaplan  a social justice and policy fellowship program through the religious action center for reform judaism  over the past three weeks  i have worked as a reproductive policy intern at a major women   s rights and advocacy group in washington  dc called the national partnership for women   families as i was coordinating the rac internship logistics  the supervisor called my cell phone and asked whether i would be willing to work for this organization  even though i had not listed women   s rights as one of my primary choices  i am so grateful i said i would give it a try  i have learned an so much information in just the past three weeks with more to come  and have anxiously awaited    s decision day since i first walked through the office doors studying women   s reproductive rights around the us  i have come to realize exactly how many limitations are placed on my personal rights and responsibilities  just because i was born a cisgender woman  while a man is traditionally praised for his sexuality  a woman is often looked down upon as    fast    or  in more extreme cases  as a whore  why should men run away from their mistakes and fulfill the stereotype of increased single mothers raising children out of wedlock  when women are encouraged to continue their unwanted pregnancies against their own will i learned this summer that     of us women will have an abortion by age        that   s one in three  so why is talking about it so taboo  the stigma placed around abortion is unacceptable  and needs to be addressed immediately  last week  i attended a summer intern series event sponsored by advocates for youth  called    breaking the silence  destigmatizing abortion     the seminar highlighted the astounding statistics of abortion rates in the united states  and made it clear that every individual has a different story  every individual should not be forced to justify their personal choice  after the seminar  i looked on the campaign website  http   www  in campaign org   at each of the different abortion stories brave women have shared  whether the continuation of the pregnancy is unsafe  or the woman decides it is not the right time to procreate  or the pregnancy was the result of a rape or sexual assault  who cares  why should we let politicians ascribe rights and regulations to our own bodies that   s the main reason why i stayed outside the court all night and waited to get a permanent seat inside  i care about women   s rights and i want to see us attain full equality to men during our lifetime  almost a century after the   th amendment legalizing our right to vote  women are still viewed as subordinate to men  it   s time along with    other undergraduate college interns from my fellowship program  we camped out on the concrete from   am to       when the decision was released  waiting   hours for    minutes that changed the course of history the whole woman   s health vs  hellerstedt case challenged the texas hb  law passed in       which required abortion clinics to both serve as ambulatory surgical centers and require hospital admitting privileges  under the presumption that such restrictions pose as beneficial to women   s health  upholding abortion clinics to the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers requires  that    there is adequate legal support that this creates an undue burden before the enactment of the position  because it requires that a clinic meet standards that are not at all necessary and will not provide women with better care    as justice breyer concluded in his opinion of the court statement  he noted     abortion  as regulated by the state before the enactment of house bill    has been shown to be much safer  in terms of minor and serious complications  than many common medical procedures not subject to such intense regulation and scrutiny        the court declared that there is no health benefit to women in texas nor anywhere else to require abortion doctors to have hospital admitting privileges  because    as stated in the oral arguments for this case  texas knew of no single instance in which this new law has helped or would have helped a woman    this case was particularly momentous because after the death of justice scalia earlier this year  only eight judges made the court evenly split between liberals and conservatives  due to the even court  pro choice advocates needed a swing vote from one of the justices to win this fight the supreme court responded to planned parenthood v  casey in       regarding provisions to abortions on the basis of fetal viability  justice kennedy voted as a swing vote to uphold fetal viability as a way to measure abortion legality  rather than a trimester opinion  with the aim to make a woman   s decision    more thoughtful and informed        in the past  justice kennedy has expressed conflicting views on abortion  upholding restrictions in the initial roe v  wade in      that legalized abortion  and then changing his mind after some consideration during planned parenthood v  casey  so the public widely kept their fingers crossed for his swing vote in the court  almost    years after planned parenthood v  casey  justice kennedy swung his vote again  justice breyer read the majority opinion  while alito commented on the dissenting  as soon as justice breyer announced that    we conclude that neither of these provisions offers medical benefits sufficient to justify the burdens upon access that each imposes  each places a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a pre viability abortion  each constitutes an undue burden on abortion access  casey  supra  at      plurality opinion   and each violates the federal constitution  amdt                  a huge smile spread across my face the strict guards had mandated utter silence during the whole trial  and because whole woman   s health v  hellerstedt was second in line for the court  we still had to listen to the final case  after what seemed like an eternity  my group and i ran outside to the mass of protesters and picked up signs  singing and dancing and rejoicing in our victory  while the small group of anti choice advocates stood still with their arms folded and    pro life    taped in red across their mouths  the whole experience felt surreal  in a meeting later  one of my colleagues noted that this day in history will become a    where were you when       experience and i have the privilege to say i sat inside the very court itself for me  the excitement did not end when i walked into work  because of the nature of our organization  the whole office celebrated this victory the clinics that were shut down in texas back in      will need amplified funding and employment in order to reopen  and trap  targeted regulations to abortion providers  laws in mississippi and alabama regarding hospital admitting privileges are still pending to the court  the    undue burden    clause of prior cases has been defined  and further abortion regulations may be later deemed as unconstitutional  until then  we keep fighting the same war and keep rejoicing at success  but as i have learned his summer  success is just another step in the process  we are never truly finished women   s rights are still not equal  we need to continue fighting for reproductive justice and economic justice in the both in the exam room and in the work place        united states abortion
