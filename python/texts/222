this past summer  we decided to take a big step forward at youthhack and launch the youthhack ventures program  a student run and student focused startup accelerator  we initially started with   teams  with   teams graduating from the program    university teams    high school teams and   mixed team   these   teams worked on ideas ranging from a variety of fields like education  healthcare  wireless networking and agriculture while it was really challenging setting up the program and sourcing teams given that we were the first to do this type of program in the philippines  this initial test run of the first batch taught us a variety of lessons about the value in a student run and student focused startup accelerator all the teams that went through the program quickly realized that having a startup idea or a product is just one thing  building a startup is a whole different animal suddenly  the teams had to think about their business model  how they were going to get their first customers  how they were going to host their web app or mobile app  how they were going to deal with payments and so much more while it is definitely a tough ordeal building a startup as a student  we saw how important this program was in showing students how much commitment it takes to build a startup from my own experience as a student entrepreneur  it   s very hard to keep your head down and balance living the life of a student and an entrepreneur  with this  keeping student founders accountable and being there to guide them can really help with their progress by setting milestones teams had to hit each week  the teams were able to make small steps of progress each week  whether it was starting a facebook campaign or starting a blogpost or finishing their mvp or doing customer interviews or reaching out to potential mentors and partners  each week   s milestone allowed them to make concrete progress while also learning new skills they can continue to use in the future while progress wasn   t as fast as if they were working on their startup full time  progress was still made each week  which is very crucial in the startup world where it   s a long term game one of my favorite stories from this first batch of the youthhack ventures program was how one of our teams  micaph  found their cto on the first day of our program  prior to the program  micaph had done a lot of market research  customer interviews and had validated their idea  however  they didn   t have any guy who could build their product on the other hand  we had a   th grader named alex come in and join our program because he was interested in startups but didn   t have any team  after the first session  alex ended up joining the micaph team  and fast forward    weeks later and micaph had a working prototype of two main product features and is in talks with multiple customers already  we hope to foster a lot more of these connections in future programs that we host at the same time  the micaph team served as a great example of what happens when you have a founding team that all have their own skillset and expertise  one founder was in charge of all the business aspects  another founder was in charge of the user experience and front end design  and finally  the last founder was in charge of all the back end development and databases  because of this  team mica was able to make the most progress in the    week program checking up on the   teams throughout the    week program  our team realized that it   s inevitable for teams to progress at different levels so we had to adjust milestones accordingly and really individualize our support as well at the same time  each team had their own different set of needs and challenges that we could have catered to better  there truly is no cookie cutter way of building a startup since every industry is very different  for example  we had a team that was working on wireless networking  and their timeline to market was simply a lot longer than the other teams working on consumer web mobile apps moving forward  we hope to be able to prepare specific industry relevant case studies of startups in certain fields in order to help teams have a benchmark for their startup  we also hope to connect with more industry partners and mentors to help us advance our programa big realization our core team and also our student founders had was that you really don   t learn how to build a startup in school  having this student accelerator program helped them learn the nuances of building a mvp  rapidly testing and iterating an idea  pitching to investors  growing a two sided marketplace and more when got feedback from our student teams  they were really thankful for the program because it was really tailored to helping students get up to speed with all the startup jargon and processes and functions one needs to know in order to really turn an idea into a company moving forward  we hope to make our program even more robust and educational such that student founders really learn how to launch a startup in   months because of the fact that students still have other responsibilities  it   s really hard to hit all the right milestones in a    week accelerator type of program  by the end of the    weeks  teams had reached different milestones but there were still so many things we could   ve helped them with  at the same time  the timeframe for students when it comes to building a startup is longer because of the fact that they   re in college for       years so the traditional accelerator model may not be the perfect model however  the beauty in an accelerator type of program with a set timeframe is that teams really have to sprint and run for their lives  we saw this as demo day approached and suddenly  our student founders had a different sense of urgency as they sprinted to finish their mvps  solidify their business models  find ways to show traction and practice their pitch moving forward  a hybrid accelerator incubator startup school program might be our best bet where we have demo days presentation days every   or   months for progress checks  and students can go through different levels of our program depending on what stage they   re in  this would allow us to really help teams go from   to    and fully educate them about the process of building a startup overall  launching the youthhack ventures program and watching teams grow throughout the initial    week program has been a really good learning experience for us  it was really inspiring seeing the teams go through different challenges  learn new things  build their mvps  pivot their ideas  close new partnerships and reach out to mentors it   s now back to the drawing board for us as we work towards improving the ventures program for the next batches of student founders i   d like to thank our youthhack ventures core team including jerick bonamy  aldrin mallari and pau joquino for really stepping
