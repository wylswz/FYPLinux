at obvious ventures  we believe stored electricity  increasingly derived from renewable sources  will entirely replace fossil fuels as the preferred method to power everything in our lives  from cars to scooters to boats to locomotives to industrial equipment  we are in the midst of a transition that will electrify everything previously driven by combustion there are two simple reasons we   ll make this change sooner than most people think  first  electrically powered things just work better  and people want things that work better  the second reason is really just a piece of the first     better    increasingly means    better forever     that is  not just better in the moment for that use  but also better for our surroundings  our health  and the health of our planet but  at least for the short term  our climate will be served not simply by environmental motivations  but by the same relentless human force that created the challenges in the first place  the desire for more  faster  better  ever better technology will lead consumers  rather than idealists  to drive this electricity evolution why now  key trends emerging only in recent years have created the foundation for this evolution cutting edge electric cars today are better than their gas powered counterparts  they are both safer and easier to maintain than conventional cars  no trips to the gas station  no oil changes  the bulk of upkeep lies in tires and windshield wiper fluid  they also perform on the road  with better acceleration  torque and responsiveness than their conventional counterparts  the big downside  and it   s a big one  of range vs  cost will be overcome by multiple car companies in the coming years these benefits cross over to other categories as well  companies like proterra are developing in city electric buses that are virtually silent  with zero emissions and the same simplified maintenance requirements that electric car owners have come to appreciate  adoption is relatively easy  defined routes  low speeds and designated charging stations are resulting in programs in an increasing number of u s  cities electric garbage trucks  delivery trucks  skateboards  bikes and scooters will soon dominate the streetscape  these products are a big improvement over their predecessors  they are silent  clean  fast and low maintenance we   re seeing a big shift at home too  hybrid hot water heaters  heat exchangers that handle both ac and heat  and induction cooktops are widely considered to be better performing  more durable  and easier to maintain than gas powered options what   s to come  well funded startups and r d efforts are underway for battery powered boats  electric long haul trucking and even airplanes         and of course  we will see home and commercial battery systems for backup proliferate as costs drop the key catalyst to allowing for the electrification of everything is improved battery technology  to move into widespread use  we need both lower costs and better density  as i wrote in my piece on lithium ion batteries  we expect the cost curve for batteries over the next decade to mimic what we   ve seen in solar over the same time frame  if we   re right  we   re on the cusp of an order of magnitude reduction in the costs of energy storage in almost all shapes and sizes although not tracking at the same rate as costs  energy storage density is increasing as well  smaller batteries that last longer will power transport for longer range and less cost  pave the way for widespread home storage systems  and make the profound environmental hazards of two stroke engines  lawn mowers  blowers  outboard motors  etc   a thing of the past homeowners around the world  particularly in the u s   europe and japan  have decided not to wait for governments and utilities when it comes to clean energy  in ever increasing numbers  they have used rooftop solar to become their own power producers and have gone green in myriad distributed ways the companies that serve them have also taken notice  from facebook to google toapple to amazon  the world   s largest companies are moving toward     percent renewable power homes and businesses making their own power have the means and the opportunity to put it to good use  further fueling motivation to invest in electrically driven systems finally  we   re seeing entire countries and states commit to moving closer to carbon neutral         and of course others will follow  with these commitments comes a clear line of sight to a carbon free environment in both the creation of energy and the ways in which we use it  the idea of burning anything to move ourselves  power our homes or drive our supply chains will be a thing of the past hospitals  transport  homes and businesses will increasingly generate and store power on site  this will in turn grow the functionality of the grid and ensure full resilience after natural disasters like hurricane katrina  the insanity and shortsightedness of destroying a finite supply of fossil fuels by burning  rather than leaving them in the ground to minimize carbon release or maximizing their value for plastics  fertilizers  etc   will be the predominant cultural view  today   s first graders will get to college and shake their heads when we talk about the good old days of using repeated explosions under the hood of the car to get around most of all  we will serve the greater good by aligning with  instead of opposing  the forces that sustain and define us  wind  water  solar and our own human nature to seek abundance for all  worldpositive investor at obvious ventures  former cleantech  and just plain old tech  exec and founder  worldposit
