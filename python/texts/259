marit stood on the grey sidewalk outside the movie house in a knee length royal blue wool coat  no hat  no gloves  her shoulder length thin blond hair was covering her face protectively as she bent over  as in prayer  because she was lighting a cigarette    thanks     she said as she handed the lighter back to the guy standing next to her    anything else i can do     the guy said to her    nope     she said thrusting her head upwards and exhaling torpedoes of smoke through both nostrils     i   m meeting someone       yea  i figured     the guy said and walked on she smiled to herself and watched him walk away to a group of friends  the yellow glow of the theatre marquee falsely implied a warmth in the air  she took a few more drags of her cigarette  her peripheral vision spotted her contact walking down the block  he was in a blue pea coat wearing a baseball cap that was turned around  the brown messenger bag hung on his right shoulder  the young man went up to the box office window which was an old fashioned glass booth outside the theatre and bought a ticket  she watched him as he turned toward her to head inside  she looked at a point past his shoulder but noticed that his head was cocked down as he chanced a look at her body  she pulled the cigarette up for another drag  he disappeared into the movie theatre  his look extinguished any doubts she had about him  and she really had none  he wanted her  or something from her  marit knew he wouldn   t stop  he   d crossed the fail safe line by leaving her a note  a total break of protocol for six months he   d passed information to her in the theatre  he worked for polish intelligence  the aw  marit didn   t know his name and had no curiosity about it  the poles had their pulse on the russians  wherever russians could be found  and chicago was a place they had come  all the intelligence communities wanted a line on putin  any snippet of conversation about him was important  no matter how mundane  lots of poles in chicago spoke russian so they easily infiltrated the immigrant community  there was a lot of sharing among the intelligence communities now  and thanks to eric snowden  intelligence sharing had switched back to the old fashioned way  passing hard copies of information last month  he passed more than information to her  he was supposed to just slide his messenger bag under his seat  she was to remove an envelope from it  and push it back  but last month  he passed her a note  too  he wanted to meet her  it was either a trick to get information from her or he actually was interested in her  for marit  his motivation didn   t matter although she was flattered if he was interested in her  she let go of that thought as she dropped her cigarette down and ground it with the heel of her boot she glanced at her watch  bought a ticket with cash  and went inside  it was an old theatre with two screens  both showed foreign films which had a low turnout  perfect for what they needed  before she entered the theatre  she went into the bathroom  there were six stalls  someone had thrown a blue scarf over a stall door  she took the stall next to it and hung up her coat on the hook inside the door  she pulled a brown whig out of her purse  put on a whig cap and then the whig  she flushed the toilet twice in a row and left  leaving the coat  she wore a blousy shirt untucked and she put her hand on the gun that was holstered on her belt at the small of her back as she stepped out of the stall another woman quickly went in  marit continued on to the theatre and did not take her usual seat behind her contact  instead  she sat in the back on a red faux velvet chair  she waited a woman with blond hair and marit   s coat came into the theatre and sat behind the contact  she coughed once  there was a    minute wait between the cough and the shift of the messenger bag  at about eight minutes    seconds marit left her seat and sat next to the blond  marit looked at her  her eyes were starting to get very glassy and heavy looking  marit pulled out her gun with its silencer on  and shot towards the blond the young man started in his seat but never turned around  he knew that muffled sound  marit smiled  he had more self control that she assumed  or maybe he was in shock  or maybe just following his own protocol  she slipped the gun back into its soft leather holster  marit got up and eased the woman sideways in her chair  she was completely limp now  marit quickly left the theatre through a side exit the black suv was waiting  engine running  she knew the contact would follow her soon  she slipped inside it and it drove off    did he hear it     asked the driver    yes     said marit    good  you did a good job  please take the    el    back to the office  i have another pickup       right     said marit  he dropped her near an el stop  she watched the car   s rear lights as it went down the street  like two cougar   s eyes in the dark  she walked to a different elevated station  she never got on where she was dropped off  that was her protocol  she made sure she wasn   t followed and at the next station he trotted briskly up the steps and stood on the platform  it wasn   t too late so there was still a good crowd of people waiting  the train   s single white light was visible down the track lighting up the rails  it stopped at the station with a long scream of metal on metal  it   s steel body reflected the dark coats of the waiting passengers like an impressionist painting  she got in the last car  rode five stops  grabbed a bus and rode back to the office she rang a bell and was let in to a brownstone  she went downstairs and opened a door which was adjacent to the building   s small underground garage the blond woman was lying on a hospital bed  marit nodded at the nurse who was seated in the room and walked up to the blond  she leaned over the bed so she was close to the woman   s face    you look good for being dead     marit said the blond squinted and groggily said     you grazed my leg          bitch    marit smiled     i   ll shoot better next time     she tousled the blond   s hair     sleep it off    marit left the room  she   d hoped her contact would be sent back to a desk job in warsaw now that his job ended if you enjoyed this piece  please hit the recommend button below so other readers can
