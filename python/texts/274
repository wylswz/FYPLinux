man  today was fantastic  for some time now  i have not been feeling too confident whenever the book of esther in the bible is being referred to or mentioned  funny thing is that i have actually read it before  but for some reason the stories and lessons from the book never really registered so i decided to give it another go  this time around  i am making a painstaking effort to read it  learn a thing or two and ensure it stores well in my mind i started the book today  chapter one is so rich  most times when that chapter is being discussed  we normally focus on just queen vashti   s disobedience  we often conclude that pride was her reason for not obeying the king   s command  however  the bible didn   t mention the reason behind her not showing up  so while reading today  i thought and asked myself     what if she wasn   t feeling fine     or    what if she was shy     or maybe it was overfamiliarity that caused it  only god knows  but the bottom line is that regardless of whatever reason it was  she should have gone  out of respect for the king another thing i picked up from this chapter is that  normally  everyone is to live an exemplary life because you don   t know who is watching  this is more compulsory for people in high positions  like the one queen vashti was in  because everyone is watching  she was the role model for women back then  so her behaviour could have led to other women looking up to her or her position to also behave like she did  the thing is  when you are in a high position  people look up to being like you or being in your position one day  now there is a difference between    being like you    and    being in your position     i realised today that character is what determines if someone would actually want to be like you  so when someone says    i want to be like you o     what is that person referring to  is it your position or your personality the last thing i picked up from this chapter is that the saying     beauty can attract a man but it takes more than that to keep him    is true  i believe that this was what made queen vashti to lose her position as the queen  she had the beauty to get the position but lacked the character to keep it as if all these lessons were not enough for today  i went to church this evening and learnt new things about loyalty  i thought i knew what loyalty was all about but i was wrong  i learnt a lot  the major thing i learnt was that true loyalty is when a man is loyal to god before his people and loyal to his people before god  a perfect example is moses  he was so loyal to his people that he interceded for them before god regardless of all the rubbish they said to him  what even blows my mind is the fact that god wanted to start afresh by destroying those israelites and making moses the father of the new set of people  i mean he had a lot to gain from this new plan  but no  moses was too loyal for that  so i started thinking  am i actually a good example of this true loyalty  my answer was    no     enough work still de but god   s got me  so there is hope for me to get to this level one day thanks for reading  please don   t hesitate to share your thoughts   ayo saved by grace through faith     writer     emcee     industrial chemist     football and man united fan     gamer  blog at www ayowright    com  ig twitter   atothewizz
