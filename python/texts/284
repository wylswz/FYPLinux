by desmond limbasketball was my first love  i started playing basketball when i was   years old and had a    year professional basketball career in which i captained my high school and university team to nationwide accolades  before being selected for the singapore national youth team  in my basketball career  i have had the chance to compete locally and overseas in different competitions  which helped broaden my horizon basketball has given me a lot         till today  the friends who i grew up playing the sport with remain my very best friends  basketball has also taught me a lot of key values  which today as a startup founder at quikforce and investment partner at dorm room fund  i have found to be very applicable to the entrepreneurship journey  i would like to share some of my thoughts on how basketball values can translate to startups below    teamwork  teamwork  teamworkteamwork is the single most important factor in both basketball and startups  it is not enough to be a star player and take every single shot on your own  michael jordan also needed scottie pippen  steve kerr  and dennis rodman  before they could win the nba title  similarly  steph curry would not be where he is today without draymond green  klay thompson  or andre iguodala similarly  in a startup  it is essential to find your best cto  vp of product  vp of sales  and other employees who may be bench players at times  but will do a lot to bring out the best in the team in crucial moments    bring out the best in your teammit is important as the founder of a company to bring out the best in your teammates  it is often easy to only focus on the best players on your team  and ignore the rest of them  however  since you already chose them to be your teammates  the best thing you can do is to maximize their potential as milton friedman   s theory of comparative advantage states  each entity will have a comparably stronger edge in a certain area  for example  you may be a genius in programming  but when it comes to sales  it will be better to bring out the best in your average sales person  and not spend your own personal time on trying to call up customers on your own  even though it   s important in early stages for startup founders to do so     ups and downs are inevitmy basketball coach often told me  the ball is round  meaning that the game can often change very rapidly  when you are leading  do not be proud and rest on your laurels  when you are trailing  do not be discouraged  forty minutes is a long time  and victory is not determined until the end similarly  in starting up  we face a lot of challenges in our everyday journey  there will always be many barriers to success and obstacles  do not be discouraged  there will also be many occasions when you will be leading         do not be proud  continue to strive forward humbly and make every basket count    discipline  hard work  and passbasketball training was tough  i trained   days a week  for at least   hours each time round  i was pushed to the limit  but i was passionate about it  i loved the game and never found it to be a chore  while my friends were out dating girls or having cheeseburgers  i was on the court training  making every single session count startups are the same         it is tough  very tough  as ben horowitz   s hard things about hard things say  working on a startup will be one of the hardest thing you will ever do in your life  find a business idea that you are passionate about  and stick to it  be disciplined and put in the hours if you would like to chat more about startups  basketball  and teamwork  please do feel free to reach out to dorm room fund or to myself dorm room fund is dedicated to supporting student founders across the country and helping them reach new heights  working on a startup  get in touch with us here or reach out personally at dlim at dormroomfund com co founder at quikforce  mit   harvard graduthe best place for students to start careers as entrepreneurs and investor
