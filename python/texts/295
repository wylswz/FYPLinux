edit             it seems i have been invited to a second interview  haven   t failed out yet     a couple nights ago i did an interview with israeli company   name removed in case    i don   t know    they sue me    i prepared for a normal remote skype interview  and called in at   pm mst      am their time imagine my surprise when my    skype interview    didn   t call me  but rather sent a text chat  good thing i dressed up  in which they sent me a link to a google white board to complete a real world javascript test no ide  no testing  no google  i was expected to visualize the code in my head and simply write code  there wasn   t even proper indenting  o onow i had never actually done one of these type interviews before and  although i knew that they were going to ask some technical questions  i hadn   t really prepared myself for this so  without further adieu  below are the questions i was asked  and what my answers were  since i was only allocated    minutes  i did make a few mistakes  which i will point out and correct below i admit  it took me about six minutes just to figure what this question was asking  what did they mean correctly nested  yeah  i was a little slow on the draw the answer i came up with see if you can spot my mistake before i reveal it below     for this question i initially panicked  i only had    minutes left after spending to much time on question one and i hastily started shortening code as much as possible without re writing it i had to get a close to five lines as possible  i ended up with some garbage like thiand my time was up    so i messaged my    interviewer    she asked     are you done     and i replied     i could probably spend all night trying to re optimize      and she granted me additional time at this moment i had actually accepted that i did poor on question    so i was a refreshed when i was granted more time  maybe i could try from a different angle i decided to try and understand what the function actually did to see if i could optimize it better  instead of just hacking away at minifying it i undid all my changes and took another look    when i realized that the functionality that was written in    lines was simply looking for the index of a string within another string i could work with that i spent   minutes and rewrote it to and i hit submit      i was pretty happy with my answer  i had re wrote it to   lines   success i had saved a copy of the questions  and my answers  in textmate  it was midnight though  and i was wiped i went to bed  helped my wife with a midnight feeding of our newborn  and fell into blissful sleep the next day  i checked my work    i had made a mistake in both functions i returned i blame both mistakes on not being able to actually test my code as i went  which is a normal dev environment  but that doesn   t matter  what matters is i was wrong   failfor the first function i totally forgot the second parameter in the second and third replace tags in line     newbia simple mistake  but a mistake that wouldn   t pass their tests       the second answer  the one i was so proud of  i also made a mistake at first i didn   t even detect the mistake  i wrote a quick test  and it seemed to pass then i added a second instance of the substring into the equation and my function was wrong  what did i do wrong   another look and i realized that i was looking for the first index of the substring  when they were finding the last index of the substring    oi fixed my formula  but it is to late note  i also changed the regex match to a length test  since  afaik  regex isn   t as optimized as length is       alwaysoptimso  i think i failed  but you know what  i had fun i wasn   t expecting a test like this  i was expecting a conversation  but i really enjoyed taking part of it i learned i am a pretty competent programmer  i think if i had known it was a test i would have tried to prepare more for it and  possibly  stressed myself out i also used to think tests like this would be a good way to weed out candidates  however  after taking one  i now think that the test environment is nothing like real world developer practices lastly  i realized that i am not that desperate for a new job  i mean  i could be crushed that i  may have  screwed up an opportunity  the fact that i am not sick to the stomach reveals to me that i am doing okay anyway  i thought it was a fun activity and i thought i would share with y   all any improvements on what i wrote  any thoughts or comments
