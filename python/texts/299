i was scrolling through pictures from an incredible writers    conference i attended last week  as i went through them  i had a happy  light feeling in my heart  this was one of those events that feel like they   re changing something in your life  and i enjoyed seeing the faces of new friends and then i came across this one that   s me  i had an experience  seeing this photograph that i haven   t had in a while i   m willing to bet you know the one in every other photograph  i saw whole people  i had zero negative reaction but this one  i saw saggy boobs and a belly roll  i saw weird hair that isn   t used to nashville humidity  i saw a funky chicken neck that hasn   t quite gotten used to being less full it took a while for that all to come together until i was looking at a candid picture that was just me  just a middle aged lady with a genuine smile on her face  and then i realized that it   s probably time for me to talk about this let   s start with how i got fat it   s pretty simple really  i ate a lot the people i love  the people i share my dna with         most of them turned to alcohol to manage things like anxiety and depression and the thousand  thousand things that everyone  everyone has to deal with i am sober  but i ate a lot it got drunk on chocolate chip cookies and grilled bratwurst here   s how i got fat i managed the hard years  when my dad was in prison  when i was left alone with a gaggle of brothers and a step mother who hated me  when my kids were babies and so was i  when my husband left me alone to raise them while he found another love of his life  i managed those years with food i ate because sometimes nothing else felt good  and i desperately needed to feel something good i ate because i was lonely and scared and exhausted i ate because i had a three year old who was still ten years away from being diagnosed with autism and he only slept three hours a night  ever i ate because for ten years i never once paid all of my bills every month i ate and i survived and i got fat nearly     pounds fat so fat that it hurt to move  so fat that i had to wear a machine to keep breathing in my sleep  so fat i built a huge gap between the things i wanted to do and the things i was capable of  a gap so wide that i couldn   t see a way to bridge it so fat that i started to hate myself i used to lay awake at night with a belly full of whatever had made me feel better and think about using a knife to carve off my round belly  i used to avoid looking at myself in the mirror because all i saw was an immense body  less human than macy   s thanksgiving day parade float  expandable  expendable  unloveable  taking up so much space  too much space there were whole decades when i would have emailed sionnie  who took the above picture of me  and begged her to take it down i got to a point where i was so sick  i couldn   t function  a     day experiment changed my life  i set a simple goal  eat enough  instead of an insane cycle of starving and binge eating  and exercising for    minutes a day  and stuck with it until i felt better and then one day  when i caught my reflection  i made myself keep looking it wasn   t a mirror  that day  or a candid photograph it was my reflection in a glass door in the freezer section of the grocery store  it was while i was reaching for cherry garcia  i caught a glimpse of myself and  for some reason  i didn   t let myself turn away i stood there in the freezer section  holding a pint of cherry garcia  and i looked until i wasn   t parade float sized anymore  until i was just me  three hundred and sixty eight pounds  not three million and sixty eight pounds i looked until i could be as kind to myself as i would be to any other human being on the planet that was the first day the first day that i understood that the way i talked about myself didn   t stay inside of me  that self hatred wasn   t only about me  my daughters heard  other women heard  women i didn   t know  that i didn   t even notice  heard i was still fat  i stayed fat for a long time after that day in the freezer aisle with the cherry garcia and my reflection in the glass door i was still fat  but i stopped hating myself not over night  it took some time  a lot of time  actually  but it worked i kept looking at myself  i stopped talking about how much i hated my squishy belly  i worked hard to heal my relationship with food and with my body and then one day  i realized that it would be okay if i was less fat that it would be okay to do something that would make it easier for me to move and to breathe  i wasn   t betraying myself or this new found non hatred if i did something to start to build a bridge across that gap i could love myself and appreciate my body and still do something that would take away the physical pain that came with weighing     pounds i wasn   t required to live forever with the physical consequences of what i did to survive those mean years so i paid a doctor to remove eighty percent of my stomach and i kept looking at myself when the parade floaties came back  i kept reminding myself that self hatred isn   t something that comes standard in women  it didn   t come standard in me  it was learned and i had worked hard to unlearn it  i still work hard to unlearn it a year later  i can breathe when i sleep again  i can move again  i don   t hurt anymore and i still have to make myself look until i normalize in my own eyes  until i   m just me again  until i can be as kind to myself as i would be to any other human being  until i don   t want to cut away parts of myself anymore i can   t manage the bad things with food anymore  so i have to feel them and move through them and face them  i can   t try to stop up loneliness and shyness and frustration with tacos and cherry garcia any more  there isn   t room  and i don   t want to  anyway i eat cherry garcia because it feels perfect on my tongue  a spoonful now  or two  not a pint  or two  i eat normal  normally  non disordered  and it is wonderful i do not eat like its my drug anymore  i don   t eat to hide or numb or in a blind panic of someday going back to a place where i have to try to feed five brothers and a sister and me with four frozen burritos and a can of chicken noodle soup it was a long time coming  but it was worth the ride  this road to knowing how to respond when i flinch at my own reflection  this trip toward love and peace and self acceptance and trust that really didn   t have a whole lot to do with being some less fat after all if you enjoyed this post
