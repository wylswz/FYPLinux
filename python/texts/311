i   m pretty sure i made one because steve blake   s girlfriend at the time katie had a livejournal  and i had a huge crush on steve blake my username had the words    emo    and    dork    in it  i picked it because in an episode of the oc  adam brody   s character announces to a crowded cafeteria that he   s a big dork and listens to emo  and i had a huge crush on adam brody   this is already an embarrassing theme  about   of my friends had livejournal  too  in my allotted hour a day of internet time  i would post about the trials of my young teen life     code    some funky font colors  assign a mood emoji to the post  and frantically refresh the page to see which of those   friends would heart it   trust me         this is all much more dramatic than it sounds  i had dial up  communities were groups of people who were into the same sorts of things  each community had mods  see  hbics  that made and enforced the rules and had final say over who could be in  they were gatekeepers  they were elite i was particularly drawn to the groups dedicated to emo and punk music  full of emotionally confused teenagers who would rather stab themselves with an eyeliner pencil than listen to anything mainstream  which is perfect when your limewire account is full of illegally downloaded dashboard confessional and afi and saves the day once you were part of a community  your username was listed in the    members    section of their profile  and you were allowed to post within the community  as well as cast votes about who else could join  i   m pretty sure you could also walk on water and then turn that water into wine         or at least you felt like it         because you were the creme de la creme of livejournal  and that   s no fucking joke but becoming a part of these communities wasn   t easy  i had to fill out a specific application form for each  and usually    promote    the community in at least   other places  the application forms for the groups i wanted to join were always similar questions in different orders  countless times  i carefully curated lists of my favorite bands  movies  and lyrics  told a    heartbreak    story  and answered vague but meaningful questions like    what does emo mean to you    i would labor over these applications  it   s actually really hard to appeal to strangers on the internet that you admire and try to make it seem like you   re just being yourself and that they should like you without making it seem like you   re not being yourself without revealing that you   re trying really hard without admitting that your parents bought you the simple plan cd and that you actually like it i also had to post pictures of myself  admittedly  my selfie game was very weak at age     i was using a    mp digital camera with no front facing camera  as a redhead who couldn   t afford to shop at hot topic and didn   t own any dark lipstick  i looked a bit different than most applicants  but it was part of the process  so i posted what i thought to be my hippest shots  a k a  the pics from my myspace that had the most comments  after posting an application  all of the already approved members would evaluate and vote in the comments thread  sometimes it would just be an enthusiastic    yes     or a quick and cold    no     other times  still  people put a lot more effort into their vote  they would nitpick the music you listened to and critique your photos as if it were a juried exhibition and flex their creative insult skills when the voting period ended  one of the mods would tally the votes and either give full acceptance or hard rejection  i was definitely more familiar with the latter  but the infrequent and fleeting high from the former kept me submitting applications  this lasted until my friend brian convinced me that facebook was way cooler than livejournal  and my attention swung toward creating clever status updates and posting inside jokes on my real friends    walls anyways         when i first read this call for the creme  i felt a quiet and familiar urge within me  i wanted so badly to be a part of this special and exclusive group  god  can you imagine   i   d be floating high on that validation for months  i   m sure  so i started plotting the perfect application  i scoped out my competition  identified who totally pwned  and quickly disregarded the posers then i woke up this morning and recognized that the familiar feeling in me was that    year old chubster  desperately applying to livejournal communities  who just wanted to hang out with the upper crust and talk about how cute the lead singer of taking back sunday was but despite these adorable  and maybe misguided intentions  there   s shittier side to this  the not getting picked  the comparing yourself to people who do get picked  the wondering why you didn   t  the sitting on the outside  the wondering what it   s like to be in that circle  the not good enough  the not popular enough  the she probably got picked because they   ve been e jerking each other off for years now even though i   m not even a fan of her writing style  the too emo  the not emo enough  the whatever  these thoughts are hard for me to deal with one time on livejournal a girl explained that i wasn   t a good fit for the community because when i smiled  it looked like i had chewing tobacco packed into my bottom lip  i still think about that         almost    years later         when i look at pictures of myself smiling  isn   t that fucking crazy  an insult from a teenager on the internet has rattled around my brain and prodded at my self esteem for more than a decade  damn liz lazzara seems to have a tall order and a lot of power here  but i feel no envy toward her  picking favorites can be fun  but pushing aside lesser thans isn   t i do see some value in selectivity and curation and building a sub sub community  medium   coffeelicious   the creme    the stir stick    of highly creative people  i guess  but maybe i   m just saying that because i don   t want to disrespect the idea but the more i think about it  the more cliquey it seems    and the paupers can dwell in the shadows of those creature comforts i guess i   m just left wondering what is the criteria for    the best     and who decides that  and how is super grouping together    the best    really beneficial to anyone will we all just pay attention to them  and be forced to  moreso  because someone else before us deemed them worthy of our gaze maybe this is just pent up bitterness from all of the livejournal communities that didn   t accept me  or maybe it   s just general wariness of elitism and ego maniacism and pack mentalities and the fact that when you mix together a lot of really bright colors you end up with a brown sludge either way  a little critical thinking never hurt anyone and for everyone who doesn   t get picked  you can still sit with me   wink wink all lovers were once strangers home to some of the best stories on medium  look around  relax and enjoy one with a sip of coffee
