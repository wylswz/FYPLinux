coming out of college i was interviewing so frequently that it was nearly an athletic experience  and i found a pattern  all interviews tend to wind down the same way  regardless of how painful or pleasant they were  just before you   re ushered out the door  someone will ask you something along the lines of     so    any last questions    at this point you shouldn   t have anything extremely pressing left  this last conversational formality isn   t really designed to dive back into the technical applications of the product or any future market expansion plans  it   s only function is to tie a nice bow on the interview in a way that sounds a little better than     please  leave now     so how do you respond in a way that adds value to the conversation  when the interview is essentially over but there are still two or more bodies in the room  just like this    actually yeah  i was wondering what your best moment so far at  company name here  was    it doesn   t sound like a lot but  full disclosure  i   ve been using this question for a few years now and it   s gotten my foot wedged in doors that my body had no business entering  so please  please  wield this power responsibly  this question has gotten founders i   ve sat down with to shed tears and gotten me invited back to interviews that were going so poorly that i had been actively considering escaping midway through  but  it has also granted me the insight necessary to walk away from some seemingly fantastic offers based on the candid responses received from this innocent toss out i could go on almost indefinitely about why you should ask this question and what it   s done for me but it might be simpler to just ask you to go out and try it  next interview you have  drop in this question at the end and let me know how it goes  twitter    tsardarr   i bet you   ll be surprised marshall darr is a current student in tradecraft   s growth track who will talk about himself in the third person for the rest of this paragraph  if you   re hiring for a growth or revenue position  and would like to see these interview skills first hand  feel free to contact him on his linkedin  or  if you   d just like to be friends  marshall can be reached on twitter   tsardarr  stories about making brave decisions to create career breakthroughs
