my barber is one of the most brilliant people i know he grew up cutting hair in his father   s salon for some of the wealthiest businessmen and influencers in london  but several years ago he moved his family to a small recreational town in northern california where i live he just might be the best barber in a hundred mile radius but even though he works magic with a comb and scissors  that   s not what i   m talking about when i say he   s smart  there   s something else i   ve observed about him that   s even more interesting  let me explain my barber is a busy man  but not with cutting hair in fact  most people don   t even know he cuts hair  he has no branding or business cards  and he only works with a few clients  his makeshift barbershop is the laundry room in his house  where he squeezes in clients on random tuesday mornings between sipping coffee and getting kids off to school cutting hair is just a side gig for him  he   s better known in the community as a playwright  actor  investor  and entrepreneur  and he does each of these things with excellence  i know  because i attended one of his plays last year at the civic auditorium and was moved to tears so why does such a talented guy take what appears to be a step backwards for forty bucks  why does he disrupt the rhythm of his busy life to sweep hair clippings from his laundry room floor but not just any relationships         important and strategic ones he   s selective about who he works with because he   s letting them into his laundry room  which really means he   s letting them into his life  and there   s something in that exchange of life that   s more valuable to him than just cash with every fade and scissor snip he   s listening  asking questions  staying curious  and finding connection with the people he really wants to be with from start up founders and business coaches to artists and entrepreneurs  his hands are on the heads of men who   ve built great companies and created real value in the world         men who normally charge consulting fees or commissions in exchange for their thoughts it   s like a recurring membership model but in reverse  he   s getting monthly  one on one access to great minds but they   re paying him  brilliant cutting hair is the facade  but building relationships is his real business here   s my shameless plug asking you to click that little green heart below if you liked this article  i   ve recently started writing and any encouragement is a great help  thanks for reading husband  dad  trail runner  real estate investor  opportunist  contrarian thinker keep learning  keep growing
