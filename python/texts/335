we started dorm room fund in      to build an onramp for students to become entrepreneurs and investors while still in school four years later  dorm room fund is active at top schools across the country  we   ve invested in over     student led companies and    of our investment team alumni have entered the startup industry as founders  operators  and investors  nearly half of the dorm room fund alumni who join top vc firms are women  which led us to realize we have an opportunity to help pave the way for more diverse investors and founders supporting tomorrow   s talent today has always been part of our mission  the future workforce we   d like to see is one that is diverse and inclusive of talent from both genders  across all ethnicities  and drawn from a full range of backgrounds we know the lack of diversity in the startup industry isn   t due to a pipeline problem at the university level  computer science has become the most popular major for women at stanford and top universities graduate black and hispanic computer science and computer engineering students at twice the rate that leading technology companies hire them  universities are doing their part to develop the diverse talent to fuel the future  but a significant gap still exists between college and the workplace and we believe dorm room fund is uniquely positioned to impact the demographics of our industry by shortening the distance between the two this year  we sent the first ever dorm room fund diversity survey to the investment team to begin to measure how we   re doing when it comes to diversity on our current team and how far we have to go here   s a snapshot of what we found dorm room fund   s investment team is     female      white      asian     black latinx vs  venture   s    female      white      asian     black latinx dorm room fund falls short of the top   colleges    average which is     female      white      asian      black latinx when asked    which of the following startup careers do you ideally want to pursue after graduation     male drf partners selected vc nearly  x as frequently as female drf partners  and selected founder nearly  x as frequently as female drf partners when asked    how competent do you feel in comparison to your peers     male drf partners selected    much more competent     x as frequently as female drf partners and    slightly more competent       x as frequently as female drf partners when asked    do you feel welcomed and included by the startup community     male partners selected    always    nearly  x more frequently than female drf partners when asked    who is the one person in startups you admire most         of respondents chose a male  the most popular being elon musk   only one respondent  a female drf partner   wrote the name of a woman  sheryl sandberg  as a role model here   s a full breakdown of our team   s demographics    out of    partners on the team took this survey  we understand that this data isn   t      indicative of the entire team  we also realize this is a very small sample size  but we think these results are interesting and noteworthy nonetheless here   s how dorm room fund   s team diversity compares to the venture capital industry the      crunchbase women in venture report found that    of partners at the top     firms are women  the same report says women hold     of the roles on the investment team at the associate  vice president  and principal levels  by this benchmark  dorm room fund is doing better than vc as an industry when it comes to gender when it comes to race and ethnicity  richard kerby   s study on who is a vc  from the      nvca diversity report found that     of partners are white      asian     black and approximately    latino  by this benchmark  dorm room fund is more representative than venture however  if we want our future workforce to be diverse and inclusive  we shouldn   t be benchmarking against what venture looks like today  rather  we should measure ourselves against the most diverse and inclusive communities that represent the future of our workforce         general undergraduate populations here   s how we compare to the top   undergraduate colleges for entrepreneurs         stanford  uc berkeley  mit  harvard  and u penn by this benchmark  we   re behind if we are to further succeed at dorm room fund   s mission of catalyzing careers in the startup industry  we need to make this opportunity accessible to all students regardless of race or gender or background  meeting the standard in vc isn   t good enough  we want to surpass the higher and tougher benchmark and have our team be as diverse and inclusive as the universities where dorm room fund is active in addition to learning about the demographic makeup of our team  we wanted to take it a step further and learn about how the varied backgrounds of our partners impact their experience as student entrepreneurs and in the technology and investing industries  so we also asked about aspirations and attitudes in our survey considering the respondents were all current partners on the dorm room fund investment team  and were all recruited  selected  and onboarded similarly  we weren   t expecting much divergence or disparity in these responses  we were wrong due to our small sample size  we weren   t able to meaningfully break down the responses by race  but here are the findings we surfaced when examining the results by gender measuring where we are when it comes to diversity is just the first step  we know we won   t be able to solve these challenges overnight  but we are committed to making progress today and tackling diversity from both a demographic and attitudinal standpoint  we   ve already made some headway over     of dorm room fund alumni have gone on to work in the tech ecosystem with over     choosing careers in the startup industry  out of the    dorm room fund alumni who have gone on to join top flight vc firms      are female and    are black  many other alumni have started their own fund or startups we know we won   t be able to change the industry alone  so we   re asking for help  we   d love to hear from students  entrepreneurs  and investors everywhere  across industries  and from all backgrounds  sign up here and tell us what you think we can do at the college level to foster more diversity and inclusion         and how we can do better together to create the startup industry we all want thanks to the entire dorm room fund and first round team for their input and feedback on this report  and a very special thanks to the members of the diversity taskforce  christy motch  henry tsai  joe kahn  and kelsey bishop director  dormroomfund  firstround    back in the
