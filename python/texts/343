hi danna i have seen a couple of your messages and every time i think    i   ll just finish this and i   ll reply     post which it slips my mind  i   m extremely sorry about that in terms of response  i don   t mean from the writers  we have about      stories and some of them are fabulous  and it kills me inside that i   m unable to do justice to them  by response i mean  after liz left  we needed someone to take it over  but we hardly got anyone  even within us editors  we were a hesitant to take it up  it mostly had to do with the time commitment and being the sole    bread earner    situation  we even thought of keeping the leader as a three person group  but that idea fizzled out as well we don   t want to drop the project but circumstances are beyond our control in terms of who replaced me  srinath is taking care of the emails and all the other editors publish stories according to their schedule  as i don   t have a fixed schedule  i pop in once or twice a week and publish stories  on the days when you see increased activity from the coffeelicious  it is safe to say i donned my editor hat i   ve been contemplating stepping down for a while now  maybe just take a break from it all  handle all the other aspects of my life and come back when i can  but coffeelicious is such an intricate part of my life that i   m finding it hard to let go  i   ve been stuck in this limbo and it seems to be hurting the coffeelicious as much as it is me  i wish i was as brave as liz was writes on heavy paper and uses the light ones to make paper planes  ink stained editor  tcoffeelici
