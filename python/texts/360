i usually write about design related topics  i feel comfy on doing that  at the end it   s my profession and i am pretty updated in the field  however  this time i   ve changed my angle slightly and i would like to share with you a reflection that i did when i was flying back home from copenhagen after having an amazing weekend with two good friends my reflection started with this question  what   s your personal definition of success in life  we debated for quite a while on our own definitions  life expectations  and so on  part of it was to build a family  to be honest i do not feel my    dad calling    yet  still     but it is something that i would like to do in the future  then  the next question came in  what would you teach to your child to become the best possible person so then  i started to make a compilation of key episodes in my life when i had    true learnings    in order to keep them safe as a bible for my future children  and here it is thanks for reading  if you liked it  i would appreciate your comments and recommendations    diegodesign strategist  mormedi   tudelft alumni  design thinker  service designer  bussiness model innovator  editor at strategic design lab in medium
