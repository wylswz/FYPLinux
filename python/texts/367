in the midst of german prime minister   s angela merkel historic trip to north africa to address the problem of mediterranean crossings  the interior ministers of eu countries are gathering in luxembourg to discuss the flow of refugees from africa to europe  namely to italy  merkel has offered military and financial aid  read  bribes  to ethiopia  mali  niger  nigeria  and senegal in exchange for halting immigration  while the german interior minister thomas de maizere has called for a new solution to the problem  those who are rescued at sea ought to be taken to centers in north africa while their case for asylum is studied in other words  eu turkey deal     the contradictions of such a plan could not be more obvious  firstly  where would such centers be established  the most likely place of settlement would be libya  the departure point for most refugees who test fate by making the crossing which has killed tens of thousands of people  but how would libya  whose government is currently embroiled in a civil war against various groups  be a safe place for the hundreds of thousands of people who would ultimately be returned under such a program secondly  how would europe ensure humane conditions in such north african camps when it can   t even secure decent conditions within eu countries  how would processing be done in a timely manner when the system in europe is so over congested  how could this plan work when it presumably requires action by the libyan government  currently embroiled in war  to limit departures in the first place thirdly  assuming that the system is as fair and just as mr  de maizere makes it out to be  how would the eu ensure that countries take up their fair burden when several countries within the eu are in open revolt against the quota system why does europe insist on implementing convoluted systems which ultimately do much to harm the refugees when the end result is so blatantly obvious  the deaths caused by the crossing could easily be avoided with changes to the dublin accords  which would allow asylum seekers to access safer means of transport  and yet  eu officials continue twiddling their thumbs  ejaculating empty words bemoaning the tragedy of deaths which could easily avoided  refugees need safety  something they   re not going to get while trapped in a camp in a war torn country  if the system continues to be as slow an inefficient as it currently is  asylum seekers will be much better off in the safety of european countries the plan will cover    of    designated besieged and hard to reach places  but aleppo notably isn   t among them  the government is dead set on retaking the rebel occupied eastern aleppo districts  and has an interest in keeping aid out  as demonstrated by its criminal bombing of an aid convoy during the short lived ceasefire  the rebel occupied districts are home to         people  and supplies are running dangerously low as the syrian regime   s siege around rebel occupied areas in aleppo tightens  all kinds of goods are difficult to come by  hospitals and clinics are in especially bad shape  as they are regularly targeted by russian and syrian airstrikes and the shortages  as such  if the regime does not weaken its grasp  other means of delivery will be necessary as fall and winter weather approaches  police say the number of refugees and migrants trying to get across greece   s northern land border with turkey is growing  hundreds of asylum seekers have continued attempting to cross the frontier during the past several weeks despite authorities recently breaking up a smuggling ring on the greek side and arresting    people  much less dangerous than the sea crossing from turkey to greece   s eastern aegean islands  many asylum seekers have been apprehended after walking across the shallows of the hebrus river  which marks the greek turkish border the following helpful information was posted on facebook    if you want to be
