in silicon valley  there is an entrepreneur on every corner  and a new you sit at home naked while i do your shopping app every week  only a handful of companies  proportionally speaking  are actually trying to do things that will have a meaningful impact  and the organizations that have true vision are generally underfunded and unnoticed many startups define their mission just well enough to discover an avenue to revenue  and some don   t even want revenue  they just want users  because lately that   s as good as cash when going in for a round of funding  most of these startups die within the year  and most people will forget their names long before then last week  i read this amazing piece by mark suster on why he invested in imbellus and its founder  rebecca kantar  a few sentences really struck me   full disclosure  i   ve been guilty of thinking small  too  i   ve launched my own products        and they were fun to build  they were received well by tech blogs  users were singing our praises  the front page of reddit was an interesting place to be  twice  my ego was being stroked at maximum efficiency  and throughout all that  i knew i was building things just because people would use them i   m done with that shit if you   re going to start a new venture  care  find a problem you really care about solving and pursue that  even if the likelihood of success is slim  put your head down and go  sure  elon musk is an outlier on the intelligence spectrum  but the dude was almost certain that tesla and spacex would both fail  and they would have had he not signed away the rest of his fortune to save his companies  real talk  i want to give this guy a hug  undeniably  he has a vision and is willing to sacrifice everything for it  watch this for    seconds and tell me you don   t feel how much he cares homie is tearing up because that   s how much he cares about seeing his mission through  can you imagine believing in your company that much  and it seems to me that elon   s success is because of the singular and noble purpose his companies have  not in spite of them he has an unrelenting focus to achieve his goals because his mission is bigger than himself  his vision doesn   t take into consideration his paycheck  it doesn   t plan to be a good story at a dinner party  elon does it because the world will be better off when he completes his mission entrepreneurs are re iterating on solved problems silicon valley is filled with intelligent and capable minds that are constantly looking for ways to exploit markets and seize windows of opportunity  i mean  business is business  and i love having new products  but first convince me that having another    best way to send money to my friends    app that isn   t paypal  venmo  or google wallet is actually necessary  not to mention that money transfer through apple pay could launch at any moment and would still have to compete with facebook pay  snap cash  and square cash for relevance applying the same energy to problems that significantly impact the world would provide more than enough drive  creativity and inspiration to push through the unimaginable challenges you   ll face along the way  you   ll face these difficulties anyways         why not make it worth the struggle right now  entrepreneurs are trying to fix things that aren   t broken  and we can all name a lot of things that are broken  healthcare  education  homelessness and poverty  food waste  climate change    need i continue  these aren   t even small market problems  there is so much room for people with good ideas to make change  and probably make some good money while they   re at it not all startups need to be steadfastly mission driven and focused on the far future  but i do think there should be a lot more startups that are i   m defining goals that are in alignment with my ideals  i encourage you to do the same  solving a problem that reflects the ideals that shape who i am is a surefire way to persevere when the odds are stacked against me  everything is spiraling out of control  and it feels like birds are snipers hidden in the trees i care about empowering people to realize their potential  it underpins all human advancement from my perspective  that starts with education and entrepreneurship  entrepreneurship is the mechanism by which these advancements and innovations will happen  education is the foundation upon which these entrepreneurs will be able to build innovative organizations  when there are more educated people  there will be more skilled entrepreneurs with the ability to execute on their vision for the future  these two areas actually have a compounding effect and  depending on the individual  can be two inclusive phases of a person   s life will i build my own organization that tries to    change the world     like any self respecting  or self aggrandizing  silicon valley startup  right now  i   m not trying to figure that out  i   m just trying to be around people who are working on things that i believe are heading towards the same goal on at least a parallel path i want to learn from the people around me  i want to work in a space where i   m challenged to to think differently  i want to start taking the steps towards my goal of helping humanity realize its potential product manager   designer   hovercards  instant logos
