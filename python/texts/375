i   ve learned the hard way that multi tasking never actually gets anything done  multi tasking never actually helps me reach my goals  doing half a dozen things at once never gets me anywhere here   s how most people who claim they   re good at multi tasking actually work if you   re driving in a straight line  and you continually course correct to do or see different things along your journey  you can wind up splitting from your original path by a massive degree that   s what multi tasking does  that   s why it   s so dangerous  multi tasking means you   ll keep on course correcting until you   re so bogged down in shit that does not matter that you can   t actually get back to your original task with any kind of effectiveness it   s also exhausting  spending your energy on that continual course correction wastes it more than a clear focus ever would here   s what daniel levitin has to say about it when you multi task  you   re taking the energy that could have been dedicated to pushing one task or project forward and dividing it between multiple areas  meaning that there   s just no way to ensure you   re maximizing its impact admit it  we want to be the people that others look at and say     i don   t know how they do it     and that   s part of the reason we try so hard to be multi taskers  it   s sheer vanity  it   s the same reason we want to tell people we   re    busy    when they ask how we are  it makes us feel important but the real picture is of people who can   t get shit done  because they   re exhausted  they   re drifting and they   re not sticking to a clear course in any way they don   t have focus it   s being a single tasker dedicate yourself solely to one task  set a time limit and keep to it  block any distractions or rail breakers and keep hammering at it until you reach the end of the allotted time if that puts too much pressure on you  try starting a task by grabbing a single post it note and writing the exact outcome you want from your focus on that task  and stop working only when you hit it i   m the founder of creatomic i am incredibly excited about changing lives www jonwestenberg comwww creatomic coi   m jon westenberg  i   m an entrepreneur  a law school drop out  and a passionate creative  life is about getting up when you fall down  www jonwestenberg composts on how to build things you love  embrace creativity and make cool shit  www creatomic co
