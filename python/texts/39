there is no consensus about what constitutes good due diligence when in the convoluted sphere of early stage startup evaluation  when a co investor asks    have you done due diligence already     or when a tag along angel investor claims    well if they   ve  respectable vc firm  done their due diligence then that   s good enough for me     they often have only a limited understanding of what effort was actually undertaken  in addition  there are often unspoken and competing ideas around the due diligence process   s actual purpose  therefore  in the spirit of better communication to entrepreneurs who pitch us at m   group  lps that invest in us and co investors who trust us when joining a round alongside us  i   m going to outline our view on the due diligence process  what our due diligence process looks like and what each piece of the due diligence process actually entails i   d first like to dig into what exactly due diligence is         and isn   t  thoughts and definitions around the term    due diligence    are vague and subjective  but i like the definition outlined in investopedia which starts     due diligence is an investigation or audit of a potential investment to confirm all material facts in regards to a sale      two sections here are important to understand  and i think get lost in many early stage investors    application of due diligence another understanding that we have at m   is that the amount and intensity of due diligence should be relative to the size  scale and history of the company  it should not take   months of due diligence to close a   m deal with a company that is less than   years old and has a minimal p l history  it should probably take   months to close a   b deal with a company that   s    years old and has robust audited financial statements our due diligence process is generally completed in a month or less  though it can vary depending on the speed of the startup we are working with  in general  after we   ve met the startup and completed our internal analysis  we decide whether to pass  wait or proceed  if we choose to proceed we follow up with our due diligence checklist and work with the founders to complete it at a timeline that makes sense our due diligence checklist is broken out into three sections         internal  external and legal  some of the items may have been done at a higher level in our earlier analysis  but the due diligence process is about digging deeper  other investors    processes may have some differences but in general you tend to find many of these elements amongst most of our peers internal  using primarily our team including our advisors  with assistance from the startup   s founders  external  primarily our team interacting with third parties connected to the startup founders  legal  our team and the founders and our respective legal counsels  remember  this entire process outlined is specific to m   group  and though each investor is unique  we do believe there are    right    and    wrong    ways to go about due diligence  we hope entrepreneurs can find this helpful when interacting with us or other investors  we hope our lps better understand what we do and do not do when confirming our investment decisions  and we hope this can help reform the investors dragging   month old startups through a   month long    due diligence process    with no end in sight   about the authorvictor gutwein is the managing director of m   group  a micro vc firm he started with his family in       m   group   s focus is on seed and series a rounds for midwestern startups  he has worked in corporate retail in both the fashion and ecommerce industries in a wide variety of cross functional experiences  from marketing to merchandising  international to omnichannel retailing  victor has a passionate history with startups  including a vending machine business and kick scooter company  along with being on the board of the university of chicago   s first student run venture fund victor lives with his wife on the south side of chicago and loves staying active with backpacking  water polo  rugby  ultramarathons  and triathlons  if he can   t convince you to workout with him though  he   ll usually succeed in getting you to try out a euro style board game  like settlers of catan  with his friends vc focused on midwest early stage  startups  objective and analytical investment process combined with a risk mitigating portfolio theory
