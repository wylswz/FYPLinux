   as soon as we parked at the trailhead  i promptly left my comfort zone    
with rain clouds still looming  dave wasted no time in starting the first lesson  how to build a shelter     the most efficient is called a debris hut     dave explained as he led us through the forest     find a natural formation  like a tree that has fallen against another tree  and start with that     after about    minutes  i found exactly what dave had described  a large limb had fallen against a low tree trunk  forming a perfect frame for a small lean to shelter  then i went in search of smaller sticks to lay across the large limb and leaves to stuff in between  a lot of leaves  after about two hours of tedious  sweaty work  my shelter was ready for inspection  dave crawled inside looking for what he called light leaks because    anywhere you see sunlight leaking in  water will leak in     i passed     not bad for a first time     he conceded bearishly next up  building a fire  sans matches  i would finally use the magnesium striker i   ve been carrying around in my camping emergency kit for years without the first clue how it worked  a small metal block about the size of a snickers bar  with a magnesium strip attached to one side  it creates a shower of sparks when you scrape a knife against the magnesium     you should have all your materials ready to go before you start     dave advised     that way once you catch a spark  you can feed it until it becomes a solid flame     as i collected dry twigs and large branches  he suggested i also shred birch bark to create a flammable bed to catch the spark  then he revealed the real secret   using the back of your knife to scrape a bit of the magnesium into a pile on the bark  after a few failed tries  it worked like a relative charm   the sparks hit their mark  and the pile of tinder burst into flames soon it grew dark and  despite my now roaring fire  chilly  i was thankful that i wouldn   t have to forage for food  that was a lesson for another day  we ate the dinner of steaks and mashed potatoes dave prepared on the campfire  and i slipped into my sleeping bag nestled in my shelter  gazing at my twig beamed roof  my son is going to love this  i thought four outdoor companies that teach a wide variety of wilderness skills  from basic know how to grizzly adams level of mastery  destination backcountry adventures  brooklyn  n y  in addition to survival courses  the company offers a range of excursions in the catskill mountains  including customized day hikes  week long canoe outings and yoga in the wild trips  excursions start at around      per person   destinationbackcountryadventures com   boulder outdoor survival school  boulder  utah this school runs all its classes and expeditions in the deserts of southern utah  among the varied offerings  courses in traditional woodland crafts like bow and arrow construction and flintknapping  the ancient skill of making tools from stone  and a week long    total immersion    field course  for        a person   where participants venture deep into desert country with a knife  water bottle  poncho  blanket and nothing else   boss inc com   aboriginal living kills school founded by  cody lundin  a veteran survival instructor and co star of the discover channel   s    dual survival    series  alss teaches wilderness skills for desert and mountain environments  including courses dedicated to primitive hunting and fishing techniques  during the two day    nothing    course         participants walk into the wild with    nothing but the clothes on your back    and learn to set up a base camp without the use of a knife  navigation equipment or sleeping gear   codylundin com courses html   wilderness awareness school  duvall  wash  this not for profit school  based near the cascades  offers several daylong programs  including a wilderness survival basics program in the rain forest       for a full day class  and a bushcraft basics class that offers instruction on identifying medicinal plants and cooking over an open fire          wildernessawareness org
