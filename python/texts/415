isn t a day in     since the spring the shining them smile and and ten to meet them so that the in charge quite quickly and i he backfired literally it seems that is the problem with the awful every beacon plans but that s probably one of the reasons why it s difficult to muster     the debut of the smaller they are in the cost of the art recharge the maybe the more likely the risk is that they will     group buying yellow based on a mission against the andes nightmare account making the final it s been any skin a bit larger so that kind of comes and when they were that the headphone jack via the bad air these nine and     ten theme is that it impacts the actual form and the phone line     uni s because of his back and     said take isn t this being what happened with some some     so

kind of the sting and people were getting hadn t had this massive recall and people     add to their phones goes on to the beach and their phone but     the problem is that the signs that they ve replaced ended up having these issues is lau     said they had to double reed casa now than double the common stock production of the phone and has been no said and this is inside a galaxy that it s the asset in     isn t it sad and     so on it so it s a bigger screen a stake their version that s on top     it s     aam and announ and some production     what is good is samsung     this isn t a big deal for sin sunday k is again i m you know they have some passion into big pr but diana brand     the latter they also are extremely diverse ipad in the sky with a sorry that     i read they ve as mentioned in a terrifying upload comes about because     again i think as much as a in higher reliant on their phone there we were never signed it makes my appliances so it s it s a bit of a huge business arrest     i was arguing and that side that abalone novels and greater stock is up a lot because of listening nami sales because of this     bank today also own     and are dependent on hand     it s     still a risky     and at the end of this is a scandal in every you call this a mess     this could really really hurt apple because they re so dependent on the and found some if the if anything in at only seven     innovation work on manners     when i switched david recommended another blockbuster product for some time maybe they should be more     diversified as you say with some time and have lots of other     great products and make you have the chance     what a learning and doing     what is that i aam service is underway what is apple trying to you when you things in a trend analysis in the red haired there that getting into services and sunday that the services just surpassed the mac as being the second thing is haven t ever for them     outside the piano sonatas and i found some apparently     the vast majority of their in sick on the line we have roger kay tech analyst who founded the tech consulting company endpoint technologies     associates pty roger     but based     on the the     problem but it appears that the racially     that there was too much impression that we tried to squeeze the battery down     to make it smaller so     provident to have a look that you have to think about the three dimensional them look that the government will pockets     in one of them in the     battery of low help because i     think you can put it in the other in the photo below where the devi temple open though     the device will actually have to do with how much heat you can pay     brokerage google opened to let it     in this particular case     the battery of low was already a specific car and the rest of the weekend but the phone with kremlin electronic tvs no room to increase     the battery and low     and so when they ordered me to design solution to     compress that make this whole thing that     don t really know recovery other than the total redesign of the phone to what it called off the park and carnival have to say to go back to the drawing part start fresh     the current troubles in the third of the good news to contribute to the point of being a     teacher in     right now anyway just because of     the punk double     but also because it was quite interesting that the i phone seven introduction was     greeted with the thought of being too conservative movement     we didn t say that nothing much interesting going on     and yet now it seems that is why prudent of them and that didn t make any radical design changes therefore the present in their comfort zone and     not having     to bet on farms but it ll sink     they re more vulnerable to     unite here a battery farm     there are less likely to actually have one of the focus on all this stuff a lot before to go into production     roger is     are some people saying that this is karma for some some given the time she s ever copyright infringement     i managed well     it is quite divided over what the religious toronto     sure what i can do that again     in     terms of of of     i don t like to get to work hard all this due to the large companies to each other you ll know that the moment of great stock of what s in between all sorts of large companies so little actual property     the common way it handled that that eventually think the whole thing the thing that greeted costs flowing from them then they go on to talk to approve a     particularly bitter rivals tend to     date that the hackers     with each other     for water but the soup and a tooth and nail     have to spend whatever money on attorney and ordered to do that but     i don t think that you think     in particular appearing on the farm implements of being very ambitious and one of us tried to try to keep ahead with the flagship phone to get ahead of apple     introduced for apple came out with better features curved screen things like that     and they should go to that of the stall to think that     the pool     the     story is just that     in     the engineering never actually     owned the     top and it didn t come out until it met to uploading them about the market     the reason a lot of things right and we haven t we seen it in a manner netease lithium and handle so lithium ion batteries are yet to load things but they aren t full     break it into their own specification meaning don t have to compress that it can     lead to pick her speech for them     what are they aware of that heart talk with other with no pro but has actually been dual     channel charging system which     would be     going into the battery with a credit to quit charge     that the pedaling all through especially one     location which concentrate to keep     it goes into two point two which tend to be a bit     of     better from that perspective so     they re a lot of ways that i think we     want to     circuitry and other things that that have been established to     ameliorate potential battery promise to leap onto the iraq war party but didn t read the book that     she battery debacle of cars recalled by open to copy and in putting up with apple and dell     while     roger wanted to do to apple s sales     um have you any projections on     howell impacts     the arts and science     well i suppose to take the two billion off of     them     and help you know after that or more to apple and the rest of it will go to other android supplier so     chubby     lenovo huawei     other     companies in them that     and that business     um so     you know     nearly broke that but     assume that dead     last in the poll and others came in with a apple gets about half of that don t know it would take a billion dollars     then that exists and then i see on a disney ninjas st piano you ll see whether     people thought i alas this is my new boss and and and     and this can be really good travel because it s been benefiting from people switching over from andhra unfurl on that and to get to hit the highest none of what they costs which is     last quarter that they never had an history send out a skinny you can imagine that only help them     but then again go for discount it s pixels i metallic sleepy at times map and and and and     and and there s a lot of other good phones out there that news and read so i know that and the galaxy and seven but i can seem as of     now i was ardi actually the messaging to names and sign and i m not saying that this is the the the the     the     and and and and and as i didn t incision in the bouncy so i could see some people mean and and     so at the moment some sunny say jennifer has a twenty two point four percent share of markets     and     apple news about eleven point eight percent     road idc magic is to come and that samsung is them that their suffering company may have a huge presence in asia are they that     they ve prolongs hammered in the hell outta lower two options that     other than the necessity were able to expand in emerging markets in knowing that apple is kind of just now starting to catch up in the end     of august is a huge presence in china and has it s it s hamrick explains in me and in other places but it     really apple s biggest best and i get is bs and second less impressive and yet     so they they get a staunch and less on to say that they can catch of the yuan to catch up     and with things like this hanging sense uninsured oh close that gap     we say that but yet to pick     their respective poetry     you know they re going to really give them what     it     but um     you don t know probably pull it and they don t seem to be     the go     to market quickly as possible with the next person what they thought     and so they will lose out on the slalom but i expect them to be back in the game to extra     it s interesting if     you don t recruit non si says that this will     could help increase awful sure if the global smart mark aspire one percentages in some like     to think about dying for some said that was an     intense they and thousands of sending in st     i just in this in the common corridor that they could do that and and stance that the sun huge amount they can keep them and that spansion means     he and a lot of people are getting caught on android phones for an essay switching     sides     japan no billionaires in a beach not all those people are just rushing over and the the     the times i a s     branch of the cf or in a research announced     on tuesday     you can be a year but that still equates to fourteen to fifteen million units during the september quarter he said     but about     a lot of news     i got it sells for apple     it so i know what was     really the top     two sides of the smartphone market so it     so that that even the one that should represent     below ten million units and     of course york times co ticker outnumber what the problem you can do with that goes into revenue     so it s quite important     even though it seems like a small number     it s silly to     say especially consenting apple as spend the still see their first down your facts on and they have never had any since the launch that sets his neena and travel is     known that he has had and still is this     really that amd is even though it is now either a small     percentage and seems like this on the main teacher them and     so many people are still kicking and crying and and you know     they like ladies and men and they are struggling to happen next blockbuster product products so they are so real and i phone so this is something that will help them     while well     i guess it s a matter of trust as well as an ensign in your brown them and apple have this     still have this certain year except for that trip up with the apple muppets     literally trip him up     and and and and and they really have you     been very very protective of their brown them as rogers has been very cautious about introducing     the testing yet this torch short term aam     foster and battery     recharging     them and so easy day to pick them apart insane and adding innovative writes     the loss that at
