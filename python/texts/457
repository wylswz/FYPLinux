articles is novak djokovic going to slam                anybody else think wimbledon has sneaked up on us i sure do  maybe it was the wildly prolonged nba playoffs and the game   eye popper between the cavs and the warriors  or cleveland   s delightful shirts optional parade three days later  j r   i love you   maybe it was the yucky crush of pre rio olympics fiascos  take your pick    or the brexit uproar  i had to google what it all means  i   m not ashamed   or our own genteel presidential race  yikes   whatever the reason  i feel like wimbledon   which begins monday at the chick fil a all england lawn tennis and croquet club  ok  kidding  chick fil a didn   t buy naming rights   has suddenly  jarringly rushed in from the patio in its white shorts  a cable knit sweater knotted around its neck  hi  wimbledon here  where   s the gin  wasn   t the french open final just    minutes ago fine  maybe wimbledon hasn   t snuck up on you in the slightest  maybe you   ve been marking down the days to tennis   s most magnificent major with a big green pen  the funny thing is  wimbledon now begins later than it used to   a full week later  in fact  the thing used to wrap over the fourth of july  with the late great bud collins rhapsodizing about half volleys in strawberry colored pants  this year   s tournament finishes on sunday  july     that   s where   barring a major  earth rattling upset   i expect you   ll find the tournament   s defending champion  novak djokovic  sliding back and forth on the baseline in an effort to secure his fourth men   s singles title at the jiffy lube all england lawn tennis and croquet club  ok  relax  jiffy lube didn   t buy the naming rights  either djokjovic is a runaway favorite  the no    seed  the world no     both the smart and the lazy person   s pick  ladbrokes and william hill have him at      to win the thing   reverse odds  best wishes to all the bettors  at the rate the british pound is going  wimbledon winners might wind up with a balloon and a bag of sand so let   s skip right ahead to the more intriguing question  can djokovic pull off a calendar grand slam in      i believe this is ok to talk about  even before wimbledon begins its opening rounds  have you been watching djokovic lately  he   s      on the      season  he   s already put the australian open and the french open   the latter of which he   d never won previously   in his racket bag  after wimbledon is the u s  open  where djokovic is also defending champ  he   s the current defending champ in all four majors  a feat no men   s singles player has pulled off   in a calendar year or otherwise   since the majestic oz man rocket rod laver himself i know it   s crazy to talk like this in june  maybe even a little jinx y and tacky  but a djokovic grand slam isn   t some pie in the sky fantasy  right now  it seems like a sober minded prediction  he even has a real shot at a steffi graf style    golden slam     adding an olympic gold medal in august  i know we   re supposed to say stuff like anything can happen on any given blabbedy blah blah   after all  j r  smith is now an nba champion   but again i say have you been watching djokovic lately my journal sports colleague tom perrotta  who is as close as the tennis media has to a djokovicologist  believes the current no    is fairly close to unstoppable  on saturday he sketched out a hypothetical path to beating djokovic  and it felt a little like tom was sketching out a hypothetical path to you and me buying condos on the moon in august  an opponent   s best bet is to try to out attack djokovic  really hard  tom concedes   throw him off his rhythm  harder   and hope he has a bad day  fat chance  what tom was saying  have you been watching djokovic lately sure  djokovic has enjoyed some good fortune with injuries and age catching up to roger federer and rafael nadal  andy murray did beat him on the clay in rome and took an impressive first set off of djokovic in paris  golf clap for andy    and there are      losses to jiri vesely and feliciano lopez  but anyone paying closer attention sees a focus and relentlessness to djokovic that may surpass even his ridiculously great       in which he won three majors and went       at     he stands alone at the top of the sport  there are no arguments  a small ask  i   d love to see an uptick in public warmth toward djokovic  a player whose dominance hasn   t been   i don   t want to say    underappreciated     because i think tennis fans fully know how great he   s been  but there   s been some stubborn resistance to giving him his full due as one of the game   s best i don   t think this antipathy is hard to explain   djokovic is the upstart who came along and rearranged the magical roger rafa era  especially if you love federer and want to see him add a couple more major victories to his total  and who doesn   t  really    djokovic has spoiled a lot of sundays nole   s been a heartbreaker  i get it but this heartbreaker has already sealed a case as one of the greatest ever  djokovic sits at    total majors  two behind nadal and pete sampras  and five off federer   s record     i know after tiger woods and jack nicklaus we all promised we   d stop making these kinds of predictions  but it   s not the least bit irrational to think that    is in striking distance  and quite soon it   s not just that  djokovic is temperamentally different than federer   i can   t imagine federer ripping apart his shirt like hulk hogan  as djokovic did after winning the australian open in        but there   s a humor and sweetness in the five language speaking serbian champion that sometimes gets ignored because he   s beating a lot of people   s favorite players  last year in the u s  open final against federer  it often felt the entire stadium was rooting against djokovic again  i get it  but the stubborn among us must give djokovic his respect were djokovic to pull off a calendar grand slam  it   d be hard to find anything to top it as a sports accomplishment in       and yes  i am including those come from behind cavaliers  whatever goes down in rio  and that unspoken baseball thing certain people in chicago think is going to happen  the feat is breathtakingly hard  requiring both athletic excellence and a mental sharpness that only ratchets more tightly as the goal approaches  ask serena williams  who came so close in        and yet djokovic hasn   t even won the      wimbledon at the payless shoesource all england lawn tennis and croquet club  ok  fine  payless shoesource didn   t buy naming rights   how can anyone be expected to play tennis at such a ridiculous level then again  have you been watching djokovic lately   write to jason gay at
