articles one more inglorious pile            washington the news that the eisenhower family has dropped objections to a modified version of  frank gehry   s vision for a      million proposed memorial to  dwight d  eisenhower on the mall in washington means that in a few years we will probably be subjected to something only marginally less kitschy and overblown than mr  gehry   s earlier vision  a four acre extravaganza featuring three statues of eisenhower   as kansas farm boy  supreme allied commander and president   with a     foot wide woven metal tapestry depicting abilene  kan   suspended from eight story tall limestone columns  the architect will now alter the tapestry   s subject and may skim off some bloat  but enough of the original idea will surely remain to allow it to fit right in with the many other mediocre monuments that have been crowding the mall and other public sites during the past    years  on the mall  we already have a world war ii memorial whose ornate pomposity would have thrilled mussolini  a  martin luther king jr  statue that  unlike its subject  is grotesquely monumental and grim  and a  franklin delano roosevelt installation so intent on political points it is more like a manifesto than a memorial  why not add mr  gehry   s eisenhower to the mix  this is not a minor matter  national memorials shape the past but are statements for the future  here is what is important  they declare  here are the events  or people  or ideas that have shaped who we are and who we might yet become  they risk an element of kitsch  because they elevate a historical figure or moment into something seemingly immutable  and some quickly become quaint reminders of their creators    delusions  but others become national symbols what do recent memorials show us  the franklin delano roosevelt memorial        gives us  fdr as a shrunken physical artifact  dwarfed in his wheelchair  the     acre memorial is divided into a series of    rooms     each offering a scene and a homily  in one    room      george segal   s sculptures portray a depression era breadline  in another  roosevelt as a wartime leader is represented by his comment    i hate war     inscribed on a wrecked pile of stones   even though his real accomplishment was to spur the united states to become what he called    the great arsenal of democracy     there is no timeless hero here  just a worn individual in bleak surroundings  a similar approach is at work at the korean war veterans memorial         its potpourri of styles includes a portrayal of the war   s hardships with statues  by  frank gaylord  of american soldiers slogging through the memorial landscape  this might seem a suitable approach for a skeptical age and a troubled war  but then what precisely is the memorial   s purpose  what effect is it supposed to have  this aesthetic offers no noble vistas or public grandeur  those attributes are left for the geometric precision of the washington monument  or the classical allusions of the lincoln memorial  or even the proud warrior on horseback    ulysses s  grant   who bookends the mall opposite the lincoln memorial  but in the new dispensation  democratic vistas offer just ordinary individuals  no one is more equal than anyone else  there is only one    heroic    image among recent washington memorials  and it belongs to the martin luther king jr  memorial         but so determined is the memorial to be heroic that its    foot tall statue by lei yixin is bombastic  authoritarian  king becomes a cartoon of stern immensity  phonily heroic  that is also the case in the national world war ii memorial        designed by the  friedrich st  florian  its ornately ornamented rotunda with    pillars and triumphal arches makes the second world war seem a trite and pompous affair  so on the one hand we have individuals made to seem ordinary  on the other we have overcompensating grandiosity  those tendencies have also affected      commemorations  the memorial at the pentagon         for example  is composed of     cantilevered benches  one for each victim  these so called memorial units  are arrayed over nearly two acres and are organized according to the victim   s ages  which are also reflected in the height in inches of a nearby    age wall     think about that organizing principle  the nation   s military command was partially destroyed in an attack      people lost their lives  and the memorial is not intent on joining sorrow with resolution or in providing national perspective  it is structured according to the birthdays of the dead  there are ways in which attention to individuals can still make a public statement  and there are even critical public statements that become effective public memorials   maya lin   s vietnam veterans memorial        is an example  its combination of abstraction  the black gash in the landscape  and realism  listing the names of the dead  becomes a representation of the national experience of that war and the public and private sacrifices made  without diminishing or exaggerating either  but elsewhere  now  the public realm shrinks  we are not stirred by ideals or by shared perceptions  it is as if each memorial were designed for a constituency  not a citizenry  and they have multiplied dizzyingly  with nearly twice as many appearing on the mall in the last    years as in the previous     in washington  this weakens an aspect of the urban design dating back to when  george washington brought in pierre l   enfant to plan the new    federal city    in       it was to be grand and noble  but it also had to reflect a democratic sensibility  as in recent memorials  take one side to the extreme and you have pomposity  take the other to the extreme and you have vulgarity  when both are in balance  the result is a kind of democratic grandeur  high aspiration is sensed in the midst of contentious tumult  now we are filling the mall with memorials  great and small  in which we sense not the stirrings of democratic grandeur but a democratic ideology that imposes a leveling on all it surveys  there is no public commons  only a competitive arena in which constituencies stake their claims  maybe democracy is always a mess and maybe its vision is always fraught  but the mall still has the power to remind us of ideals that lie beyond the clamor  too many of its memorials do not   mr  rothstein is the journal   s critic at large
