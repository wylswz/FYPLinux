and protecting your money     david steele is founder and ceo of one wealth advisors     founder and managing partner of the tsa restaurant group up again     i get     it so first thing that folks are considering investing in a restaurant     he said they first need to determine if they re going to be active or passive investors tells about that     well here i mean     i m     a i would imagine eighty nine percent of people     that are listening to podcasts are     to be considered a     restaurant     with the     with the doomed going out that that meeting     of note that the     law was     structured in a low heat with it a managing member teow see that that that that the risk of torque     peaking capital     and non managing member of the o o p     which are people capital tijuana on that     and they had no say in operation     it was a leper and the real masters of people as     they stood on the     they can get their money now that the matter     will it be if the pass the investor     is making it to the lifestyle and best meet their cited the felt that     the the the industry is     one of     the evening participate in     the creation of     something that can happen in the city of the neighborhood of ultra meaningful     it s probable that the one i have to type of relationship with the managing member     where they heal her     you know     that they were all that they they have to investors that the year the relation between them and she member     is solid and     it s probable that the band members to create     form     a relationship with their feet back into the computer     are not required to be     executed     it makes a lot of sense     and you say you know i won in the same restaurant how much of their portfolio roughly do you say     you should invest     in terms of your capital she said that one percent     of your asset your liquid assets for what is it     depends on her know     what giddy longer up to the maybe you want to try and get     it right but it really depends on     the     rest of the two one off restaurant     we ate     a     not scalable business model with     repeated it and to that one of the next kid located the geography of the new management and     your real with chicken that you know that that the wa opera     which a lot of brash them that they are     he is here you re looking at is going to keep it or lose it many     times i ve heard it to the trading around     eighty percent to ninety five percent for the upscale it so much that it depends on     a lot of variables that that that that that i ve never really fully trust the bottom line is     it that the while fresh     there s a much higher likely that failure     looking good looking i d like to chew it gets when it to the mall and store it fully scalable with     the calm of a comfort that repeated from store to store     much like traditional red and business investment     and ensure that the that latter scenario i needed to private investment in liquid     you had to fight her i can     relate to the people of no more than ten percent of overall but with that were in custody prior to that     venture investments     and restaurateur should make a fall ten percent     yet i mean we re getting     further prove that down to about one percent at most     intersting     to really give plenty reason people could lose their entire investment is     the main on the first time a close in a number now i see that all the time in my neighborhood     tell me about     how he is how you can figure out how much our economy to mention snap out looking for the cash flow projections of the roster     well yes i do we add up most of     you know what that the restaurant     investment i ve been involved

    and     it s always about the debt and cash from operations are the projections actor well you know that depend on what it looks to have experienced a bit of the of the field the pentagon restaurant or     other numbers     with them to me     the projections are realistic     the cash flow from operations and the number focus on that and the percentage of the capital needed to fill the rest of     the euro ratio are interested     generally speaking i ve the very last fall     i like to cap the operation     the people to something along the lines of the end     of     at least one third if not more than a     recap of what the typical attached     now how we lead novice investors find out that information to nasa restaurant or for that and how would they come up with those numbers     well you know that that should ever be made in a restaurant     investment     opportunity     that doesn t have     oh we ate well as     financial protection and in the financial protections     that are inevitably get the the the the the the     that could     give anyone given the opportunity     though the number should be very     claim that they were there so if if there
