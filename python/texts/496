the yield interesting that the fed minutes with these     kind of application     data dependent the summing that i know a ton of interesting if not much i m inching forward english language     the reality of that data dependent as they used it was great to stay overnight in recent trade through one type     there is a four way to communicate actually dysfunctional way     to communicate when a
