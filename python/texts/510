articles kaitlyn greenidges recipe for a drink the flavor of summers end            sorrel is a drink usually made during the holiday season  but recently i made it in the heat of summer because it is one of the best ways to drink rum  i had just received a bottle from my editor at the wall street journal   don q      signature release single barrel rum  a beautiful  gilt colored liquid that smelled like a rich man   s neck as soon as i opened the bottle rum is one of those liquors that i tried early on in my limited career as a drinker   usually mixed with burning cola and gulped down quickly as it itched the back of my throat  i didn   t attempt it again until my cousin in law  who is from trinidad  insisted i try it my first winter in new york  i sat at her kitchen table with her mother and sister and cousins and they spoke and laughed all around me in a fast moving patois that i only half understood  the rum helped me understand the music of their jokes  if i didn   t totally catch all the words  that christmas  i got an english to trini dictionary in my stocking  given with much laughter to make sorrel  you need hibiscus flowers  but the grocery store near my apartment hasn   t carried those in over a year  i live in the bedford stuyvesant neighborhood of brooklyn  when i first moved here  four years ago  dried hibiscus flowers and shark were sold in the grocery store  now there   s an aisle devoted to different brands of gluten free cake mix  i write this as though i have always been the one buying the dried flowers and not the gluten free cake mix the truth is  i   m fronting  my facial features declare that i am west indian  but i didn   t grow up with a west indian mother  my mother is african american  a distinction between my parents that few people understand  most nonblack americans are not aware of gradations within the african diaspora  but much of my life i have been acutely aware that my face says something that my life and upbringing cannot back up  on the street in brooklyn  sometimes older women stop me and speak in trini  if i wear a skirt that   s a little too short  they suck their teeth in disapproval  it does not matter if i am wearing oversize headphones and sunglasses   the universal symbol for    i wish to be thought of as invisible      west indian women will stop me and ask me directions in nearly any neighborhood i ended up finding the hibiscus flowers in one of the fruit stands that cluster around fulton street and nostrand avenue  the one i went into is owned by koreans and displayed the usual harbingers of gentrification  a whole shelf of different kinds of chia seeds and a refrigerated case stocked solely with fancy brands of kombucha  but tossed in a bin near the registers  alongside plastic bags of tamarind candy  were the red and purple dried flowers  i scooped up two bags and waited in line to pay behind an older auntie and a younger woman  newer to the neighborhood  the auntie got to the register first     is this really three dollars     she asked  shaking her plastic bag full of fruit     no     the cashier deadpanned     we   re cheating you here  we   re overpriced     and then the two of them laughed  an old madonna song was on the radio and everyone in the store  black and korean  recent transplant and neighborhood mainstay  was singing along or moving to it  and i thought  this is at least still brooklyn i took two or three sips of the don q rum before i began the process of making the sorrel in the large  overheated kitchen of my basement apartment  it sat on my tongue  burning ever so slightly  pleasurably  before i swallowed and my whole throat felt golden  i may be a fake west indian  but this rum is very  very real  i rubbed my hands together in anticipation of the drink sorrel is deceptively easy to make  as long as you don   t get too cocky about it  i got cocky about it  normally  for sorrel  you take the dried hibiscus flowers  toss them in a pot with water  and boil them with cinnamon sticks  cloves and sweetener until it all reduces down to a thick  ruby colored punch that is as heavy as blood and smells like christmas  note to any west indians reading  i got this recipe off the internet a few years ago and have perfected it with trial and error over the past few summers  so it may be missing some wonderfully authentic ingredient that would make it really sorrel this time  i was certain i was making a sorrel masterpiece  i had my flowers steeping in the pot  the boiling water prettily bubbling up between the petals  i had my whole cinnamon sticks  very important  tossed in  but the cloves are what messed me up  you have to use whole cloves  it   s easier to control for their flavor  and ground cloves make the punch gritty  but i had forgotten whole cloves and so i ran from the apartment  telling my boyfriend to watch the pot  while i walked as quickly as possible in the thick soup of heat to the corner store  vainly searching for whole cloves   a ridiculous thing to expect a bodega to have  i knew  even as i made my way there the sorrel came out with that strange  earthy aftertaste of too many cloves  but the rum made it better  when i added the rum to the sorrel  it took some of the bite off of the cloves  i like my sorrel very sweet   i mixed about half a bottle of honey into the punch   but the rum cut through the thick honey  warming it  maturing the taste from something almost too sweet to something a bit more wan and regretful  the rum tastes like it has a past  while the sorrel is the embodiment of nostalgia  the whole drink  when i mixed it in a glass with a healthy pile of ice  tasted nearly exactly like summer longing  like the wistful feeling that can come over you in the midst of the most raucous summer barbecue in fact  that   s where i took this batch of sorrel and this bottle of rum   to a barbecue dinner in cobble hill  where the host meandered toward the grill about three hours after we got there to begin cooking piles of bacon wrapped hot dogs and squid soaked in lemon and ears of corn  the guests argued about the intricacies of teamster politics and the legacy of the political unrest of the summer of       and some little girls decided i was their mascot and insisted on painting my fingernails while challenging me to a cartwheel competition in the hostess   s cramped kitchen but before i headed to the party i drank the rum and sorrel and thought how much of summer is  for me  not about experiences but about remembering  about missing something before it   s even completely gone      kaitlyn greenidge is the author of    we love you  charlie freeman     algonquin books
