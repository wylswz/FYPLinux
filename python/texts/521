articles sb                                         cairo   while relations between cairo and washington have deteriorated amid violence and diplomatic strife  egyptians have embraced one american leader   bob bradley  the coach of egypt s national soccer team if egypt s pharoahs defeat ghana on tuesday afternoon  the country will be within striking distance of the world cup for the first time since       that would make mr  bradley the unlikely american hero in a very egyptian cinderella story  after a series of egyptian and foreign coaches failed to secure a tournament berth to bring the pharoahs this far  mr  bradley in his two years at the helm has had to navigate a minefield of rising anti americanism  allegations of espionage  violence and disorder in a country where politics regularly invades the soccer pitch  right now  bradley is the only american who is loved in egypt   said  alaa ezzat  a sports columnist for the government owned al ahram newspaper  but  he added   if he leads the egyptian team to brazil in       he will be a great national hero  just three months ago  egyptians were hanging effigies of former u s  ambassador  anne patterson in cairo s tahrir square next to posters of president barack obama dressed as osama bin laden  accusing them of conspiring to support ousted president  mohammed morsi  mr  obama said last week that he would cut annual military aid that has underwritten decades of regional peace  the game  which begins at   p m  local time on tuesday in kumasi  ghana  looks like a tough matchup  ghana will be seeking a third consecutive world cup berth  after reaching the quarterfinals in       mr  bradley should know the team s strength  ghana eliminated the bradley led u s  national team from the tournament in      the squad s bid marks a swan song for a generation of star players  among them is  mohammed abu treika  by far egypt s most celebrated player and a well known islamist sympathizer  mr  abu treika raised eyebrows when he stripped off his jersey during a match to reveal a t shirt that read  sympathy for gaza   mr  bradley said mr  abu treika s politics have had little effect on the cohesion of a team that largely has stood behind egypt s hugely popular military  mr  bradley s world cup pursuit has come amid egypt s often bloody transition to democracy  some of the deadliest incidents over the past three years have unfolded at stadiums  including one of soccer s deadliest riots  and have twice suspended league play  i m an egyptian  but sometimes i feel bad that everything seems to work against him   said  zaki abdel fattah  an egyptian american assistant coach for the pharoahs who followed mr  bradley from the u s   where mr  abdel fattah worked with goalkeepers   but he s a fighter  he works hard  he never whines or complains  the u s  national team dropped the now    year old mr  bradley in      after six years at its helm  after mr  bradley failed to land a european coaching job  mr  abdel fattah helped ease negotiations with an egyptian national team that was searching for global glory by the time mr  bradley arrived in fall       egypt was beset by the violent aftershocks of a revolution that toppled president hosni mubarak that year  mr  bradley immersed himself in egypt in the same way he did with its team  i understood that in order to make this a go and have a real chance  we had to live in cairo and try to get to know how people think   he said mr  bradley and his wife made appearances at a local children s cancer charity  egypt s papparazi snapped photos of the couple eating at prince restaurant in the impoverished neighborhood of imbaba  an area once known for its islamist militancy organized fans known as ultras had been on the front lines of protests against mr  mubarak and had since clashed with police on an almost weekly basis  it wasn t long before the violence invaded the pitch at a match in the suez canal city of port said on feb           police watched as clashes in the stands left at least    fans dead in what became one of soccer s most lethal riots the ultras accused the police of orchestrating the violence and followed it up with a week of riots that left dozens more dead  in early march  officials canceled the remaining league matches  leaving players on the national team without day jobs or salaries before the first qualifiers in june      mr  bradley s dream of reaching the world cup seemed impossible  he said  but he was heartened by his players  commitment when he told them he wasn t abandoning them  i said over and over again   if we re counting on anyone outside this team to help us get to the world cup  it s not gonna happen    said mr  bradley   the response of the players to the challenges and the situation has been incredible  amid the domestic upheaval  the squad played friendlies and qualifiers abroad  it played home matches to empty stadiums   fearing another riot  police prohibited fans violence flared again in january after a cairo court handed death sentences for murder to    people involved in the port said riot  the city erupted in violence that left more than    people dead  prompting president morsi to deploy the army and impose a curfew when an espn blogger asked mr  bradley about the violence  he said egypt faces  a huge divide  because there was  no trust in the leadership  he was quickly attacked  a former national team executive accused him of spying for the u s  and implied that he had rigged a series of losses in order to dent egypt s confidence  the former national team coach said mr  bradley s remarks were out of line mr  bradley held a news conference to apologize and remains philosophical about the episode  somewhere along the line  someone s gonna say you re an american spy   he said   like anything here  the wind blows in your face one day and then the next day it blows in somebody else s face  sure enough  bad press was the least of mr  bradley s worries  the egyptian football association suspended league matches again after protesters toppled mr  morsi on july   the ensuing violence has killed thousands  often during public protests in downtown cairo  mr  bradley recounts such strife in the rousing manner of a locker room pep talk  egypt  he says  needs the world cup now more than ever  there are egyptians killing egyptians   he said   but when we step onto the field for    minutes  we can show egyptians what it means when there s a group that s united     tamer el ghobashy  and leila elmergawi  contributed to this article  write to  matt bradley at matt bradley dowjones com  corrections   amplifications  ghana eliminated the bradley led u s  national team from the world cup in       an earlier version of this article
