 setting up the two managers    first competitive meeting since      never mind that this in only week four of the season  and don   t worry that guardiola and mourinho have only been working with their new clubs for about six weeks  barely long enough to learn everyone   s name  in the premier league   s season of the super coach  the dugout matters more than the field as arsenal coach arsene wenger put it  english soccer has turned into    a world championship of managers    in other words  weekends of dueling dugout narratives overshadowing actual soccer are going to happen a lot  beyond the pair in manchester  the mount rushmore of big name coaches at storied english clubs also includes jurgen klopp  who came to liverpool from borussia dortmund  and antonio conte  who joined chelsea this summer after managing the italian national team    he wants to win  i want to win  we know each other pretty well from before at barcelona     guardiola said of mourinho  who served as an assistant coach in the     s when guardiola played at barca     i think it   s great that top managers are here  big managers take me as a manager to a different level  competing with them takes me to another level    all the ingredients are in place for an epic rivalry for years to come  except it probably won   t last  neither manager has ever stayed at a club longer than four seasons  the noise around them eventually becomes too much during their years of sniping and paranoia in spain  these two perfected a particular brand of tabloid fodder  each playing up to their own caricatures guardiola  the urbane  sometimes tortured genius who honed a style of play that placed aesthetics above all by marrying the soccer traditions of the netherlands and catalonia mourinho  the ultimate pragmatist  a defensive mastermind and steely eyed winner with a knack for getting under opponents    skin  during one especially fractious clasico in       mourinho poked a barcelona assistant coach in the eye after hearing the commotion from manchester  even spain is starting to think things might have spun out of hand  manel arroyo i perez  vice chairman of barcelona  said this week that this never would have happened back home  in manchester  the players have become entirely secondary to the megalomaniacs on the bench guardiola  who was imported from bayern munich ahead of this season  is just beginning to discover this  mourinho has known it for more than a decade  since his first chelsea stint in       he has racked up more than     premier league games    worth of experience and three titles     not to mention the nearly          worth of disciplinary fines he incurred during his    month second stint  plus  mourinho   s ornery gimmick plays better in england  a league that dissects press conferences like scripture and post game handshakes like the zapruder film    some managers are winners     chelsea   s conte said from afar     i think that regardless of the job they do  there is a winning mentality that some managers have besides their methods or philosophies    guardiola owns the head to head record over mourinho  winning seven of their    encounters  but in terms of landmark victories  the gap is smaller  guardiola   s finest was a     masterpiece at camp nou in      that saw the club retain the ball for two thirds of the match mourinho   s cleanest punch came seven months earlier  when his internazionale team outwitted barcelona in the semifinals of the champions league with a perfectly executed counterattacking plan  inter went on to win the tournament  but it took moving to spain for mourinho   s obsession with the goings on inside guardiola   s bar  a camp to take full shape these days  he prefers not to discuss that particular rival  while he opines freely on others like wenger and tottenham   s mauricio pochettino    in the premier league it doesn   t make sense at all     mourinho said     if you focus on one opponent  the others will be laughing  so i am not going to be part of it
