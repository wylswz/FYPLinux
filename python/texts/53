until you love something  you   ll never give everything you have for it passion fades  love only becomes more powerful  regardless of the outcome love is the highest of all human motivations  the lower motivations         avoiding punishment pain  seeking reward pleasure  and duty         aren   t even comparable to the power of love love takes the attention off of you and places it on someone or something else  when you love something  you put it before yourself  very few display this level of devotion  where you   re willing to be and do whatever is required do you love if you want to make improvements in your life  you need to fundamentally change as a person the idea of    changing yourself    is off putting to some  the desire to be    authentic    keeps people stuck in unhealthy patterns  said  david heinemeier hansson  author of rework     just be yourself    is a terrible platitude for accepting the random attributes of character you   ve acquired thus far    according to psychologist carol dweck  having the belief in a    fixed    identity can interfere with growth  your identity isn   t fixed  you can change  you must change if you truly love someone  you   ll be who you need to be for that person  your thoughts will be directed toward their happiness  not how they can make you happy  your creativity will be towards creating meaningful experiences for them if you love a particular cause  you   ll be who you need to be to bring that cause forward  you won   t let your current deficiencies stop you  you   ll get educated  you   ll acquire skills  you   ll develop relationships  you   ll fail  you work  you   ll look foolish it   s not about you  kierkegaard  socrates  and levinas all believed love is fundamentally directed toward something outside oneself  an over focus on yourself keeps you stuck in your head and worried about your own feelings  rather than out in the world doing good forget yourself and get to work  become who you must be for the people and causes you love  it is only in devoting yourself wholly to something outside of yourself that you become self actualized  it cannot happen is a self absorbed and self concerned manner being about something far greater than yourself is the most beautiful way to live if you want a life more than you currently have  you must be more than you currently are  said benjamin disraeli     man is not the creature of circumstances  circumstances are the creatures of men    your circumstances are a reflection of you if your relationships are toxic  who   s to blame if your finances are a mess  who   s to blame if you hate your job  who   s to blame of course there are external factors at play  but life organically shapes itself around your standards  until you change  your circumstances won   t  to quote darren hardy     to achieve what you have not  you must become what you are not  you have to grow into your goals    whatever it is you want in life  you must be that person before you can have it  until you become that person  you are delusional  you won   t    live your dreams    until you become the person who creates those dreams  said jim rohn     success is not to be pursued  it is to be attracted by the person you become    this reality has recently become very apparent to me  to be blunt  i   ve been living far beneath the results i   m seeking in my life  the reason is simple  i haven   t loved deeply enough i haven   t loved my family enough i haven   t loved my clients enough i haven   t loved my work enough i haven   t loved my life enough because i haven   t loved enough  i haven   t been the person needed to make these things as great as they could be i   m not crying over this fact  i   m not depressed  i   m just stating the facts  i   ve been selfish    love is the only thing powerful enough to overcome everything holding you back             chris chann  professional skateboardlove is powerful enough to make hard and sometimes irrational decisions love is powerful enough to commit to something for the long haul love is powerful enough to get you out of bed at  am and get to work love is powerful enough to learn things and acquire skills to benefit the lives of others love is powerful enough to change you into someone more and better than you currently are love is always directed outward people often ask  how can i know what i want to do  how can i know what i   m passionate about these questions are misdirected  they   re overtly focused on themselves and their own happiness  happiness cannot be pursued  it must ensue as the unintended consequence of devotion to something or someone else  viktor frankl believed this too  explaining it as the very reason for both survival in nazi concentration camps and for success in life rather than worrying about what you   re passionate about  invest yourself in something you believe in you grow to love what you put your energy into  you love what you do well  you love what you   ve sacrificed for  you love what you   ve changed for if you work hard in a particular class  you   ll love that class if you work hard on a project  you   ll love that project if you work hard writing a paper  you   ll love that paper if you invest yourself in a relationship  you   ll love that person love comes from work  it   s not a feeling  it   s committed
