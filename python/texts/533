articles public private secret review in the heart of digital darkness            new york    public  private  secret    at the international center of photography museum is a group show worth a prolonged visit despite the slipshod installation   public  private  secret    icp museum   through jan           exploring the dark energy of cyberspace  which is altering human behavior in ways we don   t yet   and may not want to   understand  curator in charge  charlotte cotton presents more than    post      photos and videos against a historical background of images by weegee   andy warhol  cindy sherman  henri cartier bresson  garry winogrand  ron galella  sophie calle  merry alpern and others touching on themes of voyeurism  self promotion  celebrity  surveillance and criminality  much of the contemporary work here questions our enchantment with the digital realm from an insider   s point of view  artists who have grown up with the internet and social media accept that any realistic look at the way we live now has to reckon with their online daily routines  two videos on the first floor  playing on opposite wall size screens  dramatize better than any other works of art i   ve seen this year the psychic and moral cost of releasing so much highly charged personal information into the world    natalie bookchin   s    testament              and  jon rafman   s    mainsqueeze           were made from video clips and photos freely available online  as such  both might be called appropriated documentary  ms  bookchin views the internet as a new kind of public confessional where secrets that used to be shameful are indiscriminately shared  the anonymous faces and voices speak into the camera about being out of work  sexually confused  or ill and without the money to afford treatment or medication  expertly edited so that each person has a dignified presence within a group portrait of distress  the roughly seven minute piece suggests that while serious emotional problems won   t be resolved by going online  the sense of community provided by this electronic diary is nonetheless consoling and not to be mocked  mr  rafman   s piece is more disturbing  he has spliced stills of young men in states of dissipation or self mortification with anime porn and a video of someone trussed up in a head to toe green frog outfit  a voiceover from a commercial for a diabetes drug accompanies a tender scene of a young woman petting a crawfish that she proceeds to crush to death with her foot   a genre of snuff films for animal fetishists  intercut within this stream are recurring images of a washing machine in a side yard undergoing self destruction  watching this engrossing act of metallic dismemberment  it   s hard not to feel queasy about other forms of violence now staged for the camera and to wonder if the digital metrics that reward having a mass audience of    eyeballs    and    followers    aren   t encouraging our basest instincts    john houck   s    portrait landscape            located in the basement at icp  is another sophisticated work about our naive faith in technology  on a video screen the artist has applied facial recognition software to a series of stills from the      movie    blow up     the program scans each image and makes little squares on parts of the picture that it detects as faces   the head of the actor  david hemmings as well as knots in tree trunks  patches of leaves and clumps of grass     blow up    is about a photographer who may or may not have witnessed a murder in a public park  mr  houck has cleverly updated it for the age of terrorism  both the movie and his work ask if our admirable desire to locate patterns within disorder has its limits and sometimes leads us to find only what we   re already programmed to see  the changing nature of fame is noted in a wall of warhol polaroids  a    minute slideshow of  kim kardashian   s selfies  and a twitter feed that ranks celebrities according to their social media popularity    justin bieber was trending down on my latest visit   a separate room is devoted to    free fotolab            a slideshow by the british artist  phil collins  he struck a deal with customers  in exchange for their giving him their undeveloped   mm rolls of film and lifetime rights to do with the photos as he wished  they would receive a free set of prints  viewers can decide if he has honored or exploited their trust  if    public  private  secret    seems less coherent and more hit or miss than it should be  blame rests less  perhaps  with ms  cotton and her team than on the grim  cramped surroundings that are icp   s new home on the bowery  always a scrappy institution  underfunded compared to most new york museums  icp has been homeless since the closing of its sixth avenue headquarters in       as this show proves  it has never lacked for curatorial talent  there is more provocative work here than was seen at either of the recent photography surveys at the museum of modern art and the guggenheim  let   s hope the rumors are true and that this concrete bunker is only a temporary haven while icp builds a more inviting  permanent home   mr  woodward is an arts critic in new york
