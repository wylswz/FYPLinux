articles martial arts move may lessen impact of a fall on hip           learning a common martial arts movement might help reduce the chance of injuring a hip during a fall  suggests a meta analysis published online in archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation  the analysis assessed the effects of seven falling techniques on the force of impact from falls in various directions  martial arts rolling  which involves bending the knees and rotating slightly backward during a fall  was the only technique to significantly reduce impact on the hip  rolling may distribute forces more evenly throughout the body as it hits the ground  the researchers suggested fall prevention programs usually focus on exercise training and environmental changes  such as improved lighting  while those measures help  people still fall  the researchers noted  more than         people age    and older in the u s  suffer hip fractures yearly  and almost all are from falls  usually in a sideways direction  according to the centers for disease control and prevention  the analysis  at the university of illinois at urbana champaign  looked at    studies  with a combined     participants  conducted in the u s   canada  the netherlands and taiwan from      to       the majority included younger adults in their late   s  about     were women the studies examined falling techniques known as squatting  muscle relaxation  forward rotation  elbow bending with outstretched arms  stepping  and martial arts rolling and slapping  impact force was compared with falling while not doing the technique all the techniques  other than slapping  reduced fall impact  but only rolling lessened the impact on the hip  by      caveat  the underlying studies were small  and only one involved older participants  reduced strength and impaired reaction time may limit elderly people   s ability to perform fall techniques  the researchers said   safe landing strategies during a fall  systematic review and meta analysis as flu season approaches  reducing children   s anxiety during vaccinations is a widespread goal  a study found a way to do this by singing upbeat songs that encouraged intermittent deep breathing children who participated in the singing showed fewer signs of distress  such as crying and screaming  than others vaccinated in quiet rooms  the music also helped to calm parents as the children were vaccinated  according to the study  published online in the journal of music therapy distress during immunizations can have long term psychological effects on children  such as greater pain sensitivity and fear of future medical procedures  the researchers said  the study  at florida state university  involved    children  ages   to    immunized for chickenpox  measles  whooping cough and other childhood diseases over a seven month period at three health centers  most children got more than one injection at an appointment  half were assigned to a music therapist  who played interactive songs on a classical guitar and provided the children with toy instruments in the waiting area  the songs contained cues for deep breathing  a coping technique that can be calming during medical procedures  the researchers said  children who received music therapy showed an average of five to six signs of distress before and after the immunizations  that compared with    to    such behaviors in the control group  caveat  it isn   t known if music therapy helped the children cope with subsequent immunizations   music therapy as procedural support for young children undergoing immunizations  a randomized controlled study an animal study of concussions suggests that prolonged rest  which is commonly recommended  might be the wrong treatment  in the study  published online in the european journal of neuroscience  rats that quickly returned to normal physical and social activities recovered some functions faster after a concussion than other animals that waited longer  an estimated     of children suffer concussions before age     the researchers said  although exercise has positive effects on brain health  most return to play guidelines restrict physical activity and social contact after a concussion  they said the american academy of pediatrics recommends cognitive and physical rest after concussion and a progressive return to sport  researchers at the university of calgary induced simulated sports related concussions to sedated rats using small weights propelled toward the head   the rats    heads were protected with    helmets    to prevent skull fractures  the study said   the rats    coordination and motor skills were measured by the number of foot slips on a balance beam during assessments one and    days after the brain injury rats that exercised immediately had balance at both assessments that was similar to a control group that hadn   t been injured  animals that started exercising after three days had balance comparable to the control group at the second assessment  and rats that waited seven days before exercising  or had no access to a running wheel  had impaired balance at both assessments  on cognitive and memory tests  all the exercise groups performed better than injured rats that didn   t exercise  regardless of when they resumed normal activities  a separate group of injured rats that was socially isolated  housed only with their mothers  and not allowed to exercise  were the least likely to recover normal function     given the countless studies demonstrating the benefits of exercise on neurological health  it was surprising that the consensus for concussion recovery mandated complete rest and no exercise     researcher  dr  richelle mychasiuk  assistant professor in the department of psychology at the university of calgary  said in an email     rather than prohibit exercise  we likely need to tailor recovery to the individual  and allow for personalized treatment plans that incorporate exercise when appropriate     caveat  exercise had little impact on emotional symptoms  access to running wheels before the induced concussion may have modified the rodents    brain response to injury  researchers said  reducing the time interval between concussion and voluntary exercise restores motor impairment  short term memory  and alterations to gene expression  many patients undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery are overly optimistic about the time it takes to recover and return to normal activities  according to a study published online in acta orthopaedica  more than     expected to be fully recovered within three months and almost     of those believed recovery would take only one month  the study found  less than half had their expectations fulfilled at three months  the researchers said surprisingly  patients over age    were more likely to expect a shorter recovery than those who were younger  researchers said  patient expectations may be influenced by reports of rapid recoveries by professional athletes  even though athletes have access to health care and rehabilitation services not readily available to most people  the study noted  more than         arthroscopic knee operations are performed in the u s  yearly  according to the study  recent research has shown that exercise can often be more effective than surgery for older knee patients  the study  in denmark  involved     patients  age    years old on average  who had arthroscopic surgery for torn meniscal cartilage  after three months  only     of patients were satisfied with their knee function  though this was a significant improvement over the    to     who were satisfied before surgery  compared with presurgery expectations  fewer patients had high participation in recreational activities at the three month follow up  only     had their preoperative expectations fulfilled or exceeded  caveat  time to recovery was self reported and may have been interpreted in different ways  the researchers said   over optimistic patient expectations of recovery and leisure activities after arthroscopic meniscus surgery  a prospective cohort study of     patients
