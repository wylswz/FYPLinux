   s cortana  which all come standard with different smartphones  she   s the latest sign that big tech firms believe our future involves talking to computers that can talk back but spend a little more time with alexa  and the dream of a virtual assistant in a bottle begins to fizzle     alexa  can you give me a recipe for chocolate chip cookies     i asked     sorry  i didn   t understand the question i heard     she said     how long will it take to drive to the office     she couldn   t answer that  either in fact  what alexa can   t answer far outweighs what she can  so her novelty wears off fast the amazon echo has a few good ideas about how voice control might be useful in our homes  but i can   t recommend the echo to more than the curious   amazon makes customers join a waitlist to buy an echo  and doesn   t let owners post reviews  echo   s website says the device    continually learns and adds more functionality over time    using alexa mostly left me wondering  in       what   s holding back all virtual assistants from being more useful  and does amazon actually have a shot at making one any better despite a few improvements since siri made its debut in       all virtual assistants feel stuck in that trough between what we can imagine and what technology can actually achieve voice recognition isn   t the challenge   that   s the easy part now  the problem is understanding what we mean  the context of our requests    virtual assistants today do not have effective memory     says norman winarsky  vice president of ventures at sri and a co creator of siri  which sri sold to apple  each time you talk with one  it   s like you   re meeting them for the first time  he says one of his favorite virtual assistant tests is to say     i would like to see    her    tonight     can the machine understand whether he means the movie or a person   and if a person  which one   in my test  siri automatically assumed    her    was a movie  the other systems just got confused  virtual assistants have taken a few baby steps in understanding context  you can now ask siri     any good sushi places around here     and she will use your location to make recommendations  then if you change your mind and ask     what about mexican     she remembers that you just asked about restaurants cortana helpfully asks for more information about the people and places that matter to you  you can tell cortana to    remind me the next time my dad calls to tell him about the trip     and it will know which call to flag ultimately  what   s holding back the echo is that alexa doesn   t have access to my contacts  calendar and email  or where i spend my time alexa stands out from the rest because she isn   t just a feature on a phone  she lives in your living room or kitchen  so everyone in the family can use her  hands free  the echo is always on and waiting for someone to call out     alexa      if you live with a real alexa  you can change the wake up word to    amazon     in my house  the echo had one skill i loved  it is a voice activated dj  when i say    alexa  play beyonc       it starts a playlist of songs from my own amazon collection  it can also play from iheartradio  tunein and amazon   s prime music service  say     alexa  louder    and she pumps up the volume  say     alexa  stop     and it   s off  i   m more convinced than ever that voice  also a feature on speakers like the aether cone  is how we   ll soon control music  tv and a whole lot of other stuff around the house voice commands aside  as a      connected speaker   it   s      for amazon prime members for a limited time   the echo is just ok  you can connect a phone  tablet or computer to the echo via bluetooth to play music from pandora  itunes or spotify  the echo sounds fuller than the      battery powered jambox mini  but fills the room far less than a      sonos play   speaker the echo   s other impressive skill is hearing you  even from across the room  it feels snappier than other virtual assistants  though every once in a while it just wouldn   t catch my request  amazon ships it with a remote control that you can speak into  but that defeats the whole purpose of the hands free echo the bigger problem is that alexa quickly runs out of skills  she can tell you the weather  play a news summary  read brief wikipedia and dictionary entries  make a to do list and tell you the time in dubai  in the kitchen  she can set a timer while you cook  and do quick conversions  but she can   t read you a recipe or answer questions about ingredient substitutions but even tasks you   d think amazon would be great at seem to elude alexa  it can build a shopping list  which you can see in the companion app for apple and android phones  but can   t follow through and complete any purchases on anything but music on amazon com  she can   t read a book aloud   or even recommend one   neither can siri  google now nor cortana  she also doesn   t connect with any other apps  let alone any connected home products like the nest thermostat amazon says echo is open to outside developers  but cortana can already control smart home systems like insteon  and siri will soon star as the master controller of apple   s homekit  which will connect to lots of different smart home devices amazon is just getting started with the echo   it even rolled out an update with improved features last friday  but given the challenges  it   s clear that alexa has a ways to go to live up to her potential  write to geoffrey a  fowler at geoffrey fowler wsj com
