articles ouroboros trilogy review a mythic chinese ring              ouroboros trilogy     a three opera cycle that had its premiere in boston at the cutler majestic theater on saturday  is the brainchild of  cerise lim jacobs  a lawyer turned librettist  conceived as a kind of mythic chinese    ring     though with three different composers  this trilogy examines the intersection of love and power from a female perspective  as is the case in  wagner  things don   t end well  but the similarity ends there  each of the operas is under two hours in length  but they often felt much longer  and with the librettos clearly the drivers in the project  the music took a back seat  two of the operas were world premieres  the middle one     madame white snake    by  zhou long  was performed by opera boston in      and won the      pulitzer prize for music ms  jacobs drew her story from a chinese folk tale about a snake demon that takes on human form in order to experience love  in the course of the three operas  madame white snake   s pursuit wreaks general havoc  including a cataclysmic flood  she is destroyed  and reincarnated to go through the whole process again  hence the greek ouroboros reference  the infinity loop of the snake eating its tail  the librettos borrow liberally from other texts as well  and with genesis  especially adam and eve and the snake   the song of songs  greek mythology  shakespeare  and the sumerian tale of gilgamesh in the mix  it   s quite the cultural mashup in    naga     with music by  scott wheeler  madame white snake stalks a young monk  who has left his pregnant wife in order to seek nirvana  the piece is static and oratorio like  with an adult chorus and a children   s chorus commenting on the journey  mr  wheeler   s choral writing has heft and complexity  but the arias often meander  accommodating the overlong text  musical high points included the queen of the night like flights of madame white snake  scintillatingly performed by  stacey tappan  and the climactic battle between the snake  trying to seduce her way out of captivity  and the chorus  crying out for her destruction  the charismatic countertenor  anthony roth costanzo rose above his dull arias as  xiao qing  the female  partly human green snake who serves  and hopelessly loves  the white snake   sandra piques eddy was poignant as the wife   matthew worth  announced as ill  husbanded his strength as the monk   carolyn kuan conducted  and the boston children   s chorus  here as in the other two operas  was splendid zhou long   s music for    madame white snake    has more dramatic tension and is livelier  it features a chinese flute  an erhu  two string chinese fiddle  and rain sticks  and uses the swooping phrases and extreme leaps of chinese opera to color the nonhuman qualities of the two snakes  madame white snake   susannah biller  falls in love with a human   peter tantsits  and becomes pregnant  but she is outed as a demon by abbot fahai   dong jian gong   and their ensuing struggle drowns the world  the central love duet is overly sweet  and the lengthy confrontation between madame white snake and the abbot sags  but the choral parts  warning of the destruction to come  are striking   michael maniaci was xiao qing here   lan shui conducted the opera was more moving when i saw it in       the cast  other than ms  biller  is the same  but the current production  directed and designed by  michael counts  is more abstract  mr  counts uses ingenious and often beautiful video  by  s  katy tucker  to create the world of all three operas  video depicts nature  a brilliant night sky  blossoms on trees  and symbols from the story  the leaping snake  a woman bleeding in childbirth  a recurrent  haunting image of drowning people   but throughout  the static directing  with the singers declaring instead of interacting  made the stage pictures stiff and kept humanity at bay  even  zane pihlstrom   s elaborate  bejeweled costumes for the two snake women   xiao qing sported a long tail   constricted them as characters still     naga and    madame white snake    were both engaging     gilgamesh     with music by  paola prestini  was another story  ms  jacobs   s libretto  even wordier and more stuffed with external text references  featured too many rhymes that were hackneyed  tear year  or jarringly weird  shrapnel apple   and ms  prestini   s lush music felt overblown and shapeless  the plot      years after the flood  madame white snake   s son  ming  whose wife is expecting their child  is summoned to rescue his mother from captivity and is horrified to discover his origins   had promise  but the husband and wife and mother and son interactions were soggily overwritten madame white snake   s stratospheric music taxed the soprano hila plitmann  and mr  constanzo was wasted on yet another formless lament from xiao qing  as ku  ming   s wife   heather buck prettily sang a third version of the same lullaby text that appeared in the other operas  julian wachner conducted  the video effects were spectacular  particularly the scene of ms  plitmann cocooned in a begging bowl as a giant image of ming   christopher burchett   loomed over her  but the high production values had no corresponding musical payoff as the epic fizzled out ms  waleson writes about opera for the journal
