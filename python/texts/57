original interview  http   www techiesproject com nadia eghbal tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from i was born in virginia  but i was raised outside of philadelphia  in the suburbs         like really  really suburban  i was kind of shy as a kid  it wasn   t that i didn   t want to socialize  i just couldn   t seem to figure out how to do it  or how everyone else was doing it  i went to a small private elementary school  there were about    kids in my whole grade  and everyone there was nice  like there wasn   t any bullying or anything  but it was just an incredibly homogeneous school i got this label of being the    smart kid     but the reason people thought i was smart was because i got good grades  and also because i had started kindergarten early     cause i started reading really young  so i was a year younger than everyone in my class  when you   re like   years old  that one year makes a big difference  and i didn   t think getting good grades was interesting at all  and reading was just like  something that happened  like i literally found a book on the side of the road and i took it home and it was this book of animal poems and that   s how i learned to read  getting good grades was just what was expected of me by my parents  you get straight a   s in school  like that   s what you do  i didn   t feel intellectually challenged in school at all  and so i kind of hated that label  i hated being    the smart kid     it was like because i got good grades in school  that was all anybody knew me for  because everybody gets a label  right  there was one girl who liked to draw  so she was the    artsy kid     but if you were the    smart kid    you couldn   t also be the    artsy kid    because you can only have one label at a time  and i hated being reduced to something so one dimensional just because i   d done what was expected of me i found a lot of the people and the kind of stimulation i was looking for online  we got aol when i was    and i would play a lot of rpgs through chat rooms and mailing lists on there  i loved muds  which are these text based rpgs  no visuals  everything is a written description  they   re still my favorite kind of game  especially the smaller ones  where the people who made the game were just other characters you hang out with in the game  and there was such a strong sense of community that was built by the players themselves  not handed to you by some big game company or whatever  and the makers were always building new areas for you to explore and doing silly things  because it was just text  right  so it was easy to make more stuff  but those games became my world  like my whole social world i   m really old school about games  i like where people just sort of agree on a set of rules and then the rest is left to your imagination  i love how you can turn those worlds into anything you want  i think at some point in real life  like way into my adult life  i realized    fuck it     like you can do that in real life too  everything is malleable  it   s this really beautiful thing  like games are actually just reality and vice versa i kind of stopped playing games in high school but then i ended up spending a lot of time on random online forums and making friends on there  it was the same sort of thing where you had to figure out all these social norms and learn how to make friends and politic a bit  and that felt more natural to me  reading and typing and making friends that way  than doing it in real life  where in real life people kind of look at you and tell you who you are based on something that   s sort of out of your control  like i didn   t know my dad had an accent until i was in junior high  i didn   t know i didn   t look white until somebody told me  i didn   t know i was like  a woman  until i started getting that kind of attention i think i just got along better with people online because nobody knew who anyone was in real life and it didn   t really matter  like i was in this guild for awhile and they finally figured out i was   years old and then it got awkward  it was a big deal if you even knew someone   s first name in real life instead of their character name or username  i mean this was all pre facebook or whatever  and i remember people would have  like  one photo they would upload to the game website and be like    this is me  this is what i look like     so yeah it was just very detached from the real world and i liked that i could just be me and not be this flat    smart kid    character  where like  any time you had an original thought people were like    oh  it   s    cause she   s smart     which seemed incredibly reductive and boring and not interesting to me in real life anyway  so then i went to a quaker high school  which was super impactful in the way i was brought up  it was much more challenging and interesting  it just kind of like         it just gave me really good framework on the rest of life  quakers are sort of like the hippy branch of christians that are all about equality  and everything was about sitting in a circle and talking out your feelings  they believe everyone has this same sort of    that of god    inside them  everyone has something worth sharing  and that   s what brings us together  so it was just really influential for me let   s see  what else  my dad is persian  but he grew up in germany  and my mom is chinese indonesian  but she grew up in indonesia  i was in suburban pennsylvania so there was a lot of culture mixing and everything  my mom lived in indonesia when i was younger and my dad was in pennsylvania  i spent a lot of time in indonesia and a lot of time in pennsylvania  i   ve always just kind of felt in between everything  everything is kind of the same  it   s all a matter of perspective and i think that   s carried with me throughout the rest of my life i went to college at tufts in boston  came out of college  wanted to move to san francisco because it was warm and different  i had been on the east coast         north east         my whole life  san francisco was like a whole other world for me  being in a super suburban environment was         i just kind of felt like i never really belonged  it was not a great place for creativity to thrive  i even felt like being in boston or d c  or wherever  there was just such an east coast way of doing things  and on the west coast it was like     be free  be yourself  whatever     i was really overwhelmed when i first moved to san francisco because i was like      oh my god  there are other people my age that are doing things that are crazier than me  and like  how did i miss out on this  my life is over  i   m        not true  of course         and i sort of learned to get into the flow and the balance of things  everyone here is so  so introspective and there is always something you can fix and change about yourself  and that appeals to such a big part of my brain and is very exciting  but then  i think especially in recent years it   s kind of been around managing  like  alright  there   s a point where you can be happy and where you can decide what you do and you don   t want to do  so  yeah when did you first get interested in tech as a career kind of by accident  so i was         i thought i was going to go into environmental policy after tufts  and then i ended up doing stuff around impact investing and working with foundations and university endowments to invest their money into more socially conscious things  that ended up giving me a little bit of a detour  i ended up going to san francisco and working with a strategy consulting firm that specialized in nonprofits  and so i got placed with an education nonprofit  and that education nonprofit happened to also be a website         it was called greatschools  and so they provide free k to    data for parents and teachers and students and whatever to help them choose a school  i just thought that was really cool because they were just offering this information for free  they were just doing it because they thought it made sense  that was my first introduction to technology  through the nonprofit site  i saw technology as kind of a way to influence ideas more quickly than i was able to in nonprofit roles  i still felt like i had the same sort of goals and objectives as i did in nonprofit world  there are a lot of things that are so slow moving when it comes to nonprofits  and with tech it   s just like     you have an idea  you can get implemented  you can do it     so that really appealed to me walk me through your next steps  you   ve done entrepreneurship  you ended up in vc  you   re working in open source world  walk me through all of that i don   t really know how i ended up doing all sort of different things  chuckles   i think after being at the education nonprofit  i left to start a company with my roommate at the time  because that   s what you do  it was sort of like me wanting to try my hand at something fun  i don   t think there is really anything deeper to it  i was learning how to code at the time and teaching myself how to code  it was fun and we kind of made something  i was super inexperienced  i remember when we made the website  i was like     i think i can put a website together  maybe     and my co founder was like     sure  whatever     so it was just kind of like a fun project for us  that started growing into a business  and that was really exciting we went through the     startups accelerator  we went into raising money  and kind of seeing how well supported startups and venture were         and how well the ecosystem works  basically  if you have an idea  there   s going to be capital out there to support you  no one is saying that startups don   t get funded enough  i think  fundamentally  it was just really creatively enabling to realize that you can do that  i kind of wanted to be able to provide that to other people too  right so being on the venture side afterwards         we ended up selling our company to a food brand         because we realized cooking was not our lifelong passion  but it was fun so i ended up joining this venture capital firm  it was a lot of fun  i just started feeling really sucked into  chuckles  the machine of it all  and that   s not a knock against funders  it   s not even a knock against venture capital i think i   ve moved around a lot of different sectors because i actually didn   t really grow up thinking of myself as a creative person  but now people keep telling me i am  so maybe i am  in just the sense of i kind of want to do whatever i feel like doing  and so sometimes i feel like playing around in venture  and sometimes i feel like playing around in startups or whatever  but i want to be wherever the best place is for ideas to happen  and i felt like  with venture         and i think that   s why i   ve been drawn to the funding side  even with impact investing stuff before  i love the idea of being able to enable other people to be creative  i love the  just the idea of helping people be the most    them    that they are  and just pulling out whatever is unique and special about people and really encouraging it  and so funding can be a really great mechanism for that because you   re enabling somebody to do something  but  i think they   re         it sounds like that on paper with venture  but it doesn   t always work out that way and right now  working in open source and basically i   m trying to help people understand a lot of the risks and problems in supporting open source infrastructure right now  and the best part about it right now is being able to work with really  really creative people all the time  i love hearing people   s crazy stories  i love hearing how they   ve had to grapple with other people  i think the coolest thing about open source right now is that it is just         it all comes down to community and working with people and there   s nothing you can really automate about it  it would just never work  so you have to learn how to talk to people  you have to learn how to get along with lots of people and make it all come together somehow  so i feel really happy just being around creativity and feeling enabled and validated and all that let   s back up  tell me more about what it was like being a lady entrepreneur  being part of that world  fundraising  eventually selling  what was that experience like i wasn   t doing most of the fundraising so that made that part easier   laughter  it was actually kind of funny  i was the person building the products and people would always go     oh  you   re a female coder     or whatever  which was sort of funny  but i guess worked to our advantage because it was a positive expectation for people  the thing that bothered me about being a founder was that if i told people that we had a food company  they would always assume my co founder was female and they would just be like     oh  women  food  makes perfect sense  women do fashion companies and food companies and stuff     and i never thought of myself as that         it was just something that we wanted to do at the time and it was just like     you   re my roommate     you know i felt like i was being forced into some sort of weird stereotype that i didn   t really identify with  yeah  actually  i really love cooking  personally  i still do  but it doesn   t make me womanly  that i like to cook  there are plenty of guys who like to cook  it was just this weird pushback against my gender  the same thing happened in venture  where everyone calls you a woman vc  i was like  i don   t want to be a woman vc  i just want to be an investor  like anybody else it definitely has its advantages  i have no way of proving this  but i felt like it was easier for people to open up to women in a one on one conversation  at least  i found that i would learn things very quickly  like really personal stories  about founders that i talked to  that was cool  then on the other hand  there would be boundary crossing with other investors in other firms  or with founders i talked to  where it suddenly gets a little too close  and it   s like     i don   t know how to manage this     i feel like there   s always this adjective being attached to everything i   m doing  that   s like     you   re the female     like     so cool  you   re a woman     i   m like     yep  i   m a woman  i don   t really know what else you want me to say     i only want to do things that feel really natural to me  so this stuff feels really natural  and so that   s why i do it  it feels awkward when somebody retroactively puts this adjective on me that i don   t even feel like i identify that strongly with you brought up that you downplay your gender in the workplace  which i could totally relate to when i worked in tech  i am so much more feminine         i   m still not super feminine  but i   m so much more feminine now as a photographer who works for myself than when i was in tech it   s odd because sometimes i don   t know whether i feel like i don   t identify that strongly with the woman label because identifying with it would downplay my own power and influence  or whether because i truly don   t identify with it  so it   s like a really odd thing to manage  i make a point to wear basically the same thing all the time all black  yeah me too   laughter just dress down  like don   t wear anything that   s too form fitting  err on the side of pants and sneakers and stuff  people joke around with me about it  i   m like     honestly it makes a difference     it makes me feel like when i talk to people they   re at least not looking at my body or something  it   s sort of weird that we have to do it  but i hate being looked at  i think that   s why i prefer writing to speaking  honestly  or just being behind a screen  because then i feel like people are paying attention to my ideas instead of my face or what i   m wearing or whatever i totally get it  have you experienced in the same way that i did  people making assumptions about why you were even around  in a networking sense  at events or things like that i haven   t had anyone say that to my face  thank goodness  but definitely a lot of the         i   m standing in the circle with a bunch of people  and all the guys get asked what they do  and the woman is just assumed to be     oh  she   s probably someone   s girlfriend     even if the conversation is highly relevant to what i   m doing  i jump in and make comments about the ideas like anyone else would  and they kind of just look at you like     oh  that   s cute     and keep talking  the most validating time  i have to say  to have this happen was being in vc  because when you say the word vc  the mic drops and everybody   s like     oh my god  you have money     which i thought was just funny because people   s tones would just change completely when they realize that  and i   m like     yep  you probably shouldn   t do that    what was the impetus for turning your attention to open source and giving back to the industry in a way there were a lot of things  my story changes a little bit every time  because it honestly was a lot of different reasons  i think that  honestly  i was feeling a little bit burned out by venture  it was truly the most fun and the most hard job i   ve had so far  but after i left i really thought about     do i even want to be in tech any more  like  i should just go     like     fuck this place     and really thought about moving out of san francisco  really thought about whether i just want to do something completely different  and even experimented and talked to people about it and really gave it some serious exploration  and in the end i realized     i actually love technology     like  there   s a reason why i came into this sector  i really  really  really  really love it  i could not picture myself anywhere else  and that comes with all these other strings attached  but i love being here  and so i kind of had to find     what is it that i still love about it that can make me happy     and i realized that chasing after the next unicorn or trying to get into the next hot deal is just not fulfilling for me  and i think it required a lot of mental adjustment  too  because you get told         when you   re in the startup venture binary         being in venture is like you hold the purse strings  you have all this cachet and people invite you to things and people think you   re important and whatever  and so you get this false sense of status which is kind of ridiculous  and it felt weird to be like     why don   t i want this     or like    why doesn   t this make me happy     it took awhile to just let that go and say this is not where i want to be and if i do this i   m going to be really unhappy and i want to be around things that make me happy and so it just started with like     what can i do that makes me happy        and like    where do i want to be     and that   s how i ended up here because once i started talking to people in the open source world  i just felt really happy  i felt really at home  i felt like people understood me and my mindset and i wasn   t feeling like i had to defend this core sense of identity all the time so  yeah  that   s why i   m here what fatigued you on the industry during your time either as an entrepreneur or a vc many trends over time  and there was plenty of good stuff too  i still feel like i have great friends in the industry  i just felt fundamentally not like me  which was like this gut feeling  i felt like there were constantly people around me telling me i had to be a certain way that i wasn   t and i guess i actually didn   t really realize how feminine my outlook is  if you can call it feminine in vc for example  people talk about     are there enough women in venture     and they talk about discrimination  i actually don   t think the discrimination is that obvious  it   s not really about  did someone make a sexist remark at you or something  but it   s more of  i feel like my point of view was just not compatible with venture  where venture is highly  highly competitive  and it   s about bravado  and i don   t know  just posturing  being something you   re not  whatever  and this is true with founders too  i think  i   m super  super cooperative  i like finding ways to bring everyone together  and let   s work towards a solution  i   m really inspired by multiple sectors  and how do nonprofits and for  profits work together  like venture and foundations  and so i love just thinking across a lot of different things  and i felt like that was just not a point of view that was appreciated  even with startups  it   s like     execute execute        hustle hustle     and then just  aaahh  i just want to         it was so binary for me to think that way  and i think very fluidly  and there   s trade offs for both  but it   s just i think i felt burnt out over time  because i felt i was being forced to be this binary supercharged hustler  it   s like     that is not who i am  and is that okay world  if i   m not    did you have early support networks when you came here  and where do you find those now yeah  that   s a good question  nobody has asked me that i did not really know anybody when i moved here  i had one friend from tufts who i didn   t know super well but we   re now really close friends  i had a couple people that i knew through this fellowship that i was doing when i moved out here  and cobbled together a friend network from that  those people ended up becoming my closest friends  so i felt supported in that way  and my partner  who   s my biggest source of support and positive influence in my life  he came out of that circle of friends  too in terms of support network for tech  it happened slowly and over time  i   m trying to think back  there were a couple people that were really  really useful and supportive early on  literally  a couple  anything i knew that i wanted to do  probably came from popping into a network of sorts  when i learned how to code  there weren   t a whole lot of bootcamps or courses  it was still a fairly opaque process  i joined the women who code group in the meetup here  and it just gave me such a safe space to do something that was so intimidating  i   m so thankful for women who code  just having people around you who are willing to be helpful  and sharing resources  that was just very helpful  to tap into something where by tapping into one thing  you   re connected to a whole bunch more stuff  then with being a founder      startups helped tap into a certain network as well  i think that   s probably the benefit of accelerators for a lot of people  it   s like     oh  now you   re part of this network and part of this family     or whatever  then with doing vc  i think being at a fund that already had a great reputation was so  so helpful  people would just be like     oh  i know your partner     or     i know your investments     and like     you guys are a great fund     and whatever  that   s like the ultimate tapping into a network  vcs are everywhere  that probably expanded my network the most i   ve never been great at asking people for individual support  like one on one support  people will make fun of me for it  i kind of suck at finding mentors and whatever  but i just try to be nice and make friends  trying to give as much as i can is         i know it sounds like everybody says it  but         when you do that a little bit  it ends up coming back and helping you  i just try to take a really         and there have been some friends of mine who have really influenced my thinking on that  of just being like     give  give  give  be super  super  super fucking nice     and like     never give anybody a reason to hate you     that works really well  i guess i never really thought of myself as a super social person or like a networky kind of person  i think of myself as actually sort of antisocial  but then all my friends are always like     you are the most calendered antisocial person i know     so  i don   t know  it sort of happens  i guess  i try to be nice and friendly  and stuff just sort of comes my way that way  i wish i were better at asking for help though no  i   m exactly the same  you can probably relate  i had no money or power in tech  so my currency was social yeah  totally i would intro people to people  or i do favors for people  or whatever  i would do anything for people because it was free  and that   s like literally how i built my value in tech it   s actually a funny mindset  i used to  like  literally            i will help you with whatever  just let me help you     now i have to think about     all right  what do i actually need to say no to  to manage my time better     and it   s been a funny mindset to transition out of  or like  scale out of  because i really want to be helpful to everyone  but  oh yeah  i can   t just go and do    different projects  i need to do the one that i want to do  but i think it   s like         it has felt that easy to just sort of be helpful wherever i can  but to look back at it  i feel like     i don   t know how all that worked out    yeah  if you haven   t read essentialism yet  it   s probably a good time in your life to read it oooh it talks about the paradox of success and how we became successful because we had this vision  and we work super  super hard and we   re opportunistic  so you get to this level of success and then you suddenly have a million inbound options and opportunities to choose from  you have people who want to work with you  people who have cool projects for you  job offers  people who want to get coffee with you  an you   re an opportunistic person  and you want to be helpful so you want to do all those things  but then you end up stuck at this plateau because you   re busy  your energy   s now distributed towards addressing all of these options and opportunities and then you forget what you   re even going for in the first place  it   s a great book  would recommend that actually describes my life right now  i need to read this i always have a copy at my house  so when you come and take your picture i   m probably just going to send it away with you yay   chuckle what are your biggest motivators  what drives you what drives me  i really believe strongly on the power of creativity in individuals and to unlock that underlying ability  i know that   s super cheesy but it   s just so true  when i think about everything even in my personal life  like my personal interests  friendships  relationships  everything         it   s all about enabling some personal weirdness about myself and other people  if people feel like they can   t be really them  how can we make it so that people feel comfortable  i love one on one conversations with people because it   s just a matter of kinda drawing all their stories and  how do you do that to hopefully get them to open up  it makes me happier than anything else in the world  i   m very story driven  i just love hearing things that are different about other people  getting other people   s perspectives  its why i love doing what i   m doing right now  because it   s tons of weird stories and you have to talk to people and earn their trust and then they might open up to you  everything i do  i want it to be around that that   s awesome  it   s like what i tweeted like a week ago or something     there are extroverts and introverts  but there   s need to be a word for people who get their energy exclusively from one on ones    yes i am that person  chuckle  that   s a word that   s really hard to scale a time to  because i love meeting people even if it   s somebody that in the end there   s no real way for us to work together or whatever  i just love sitting there and listening to them  like     that   s awesome  tell me more     chuckle how do your friends and family at home feel about the work that you   ve done my mom has been actually super awesome and supportive  both my parents have been really supportive  i wouldn   t have thought they were going to be when i first graduated and everything  my dad is always super  super encouraging         motivating me to    do what you need to do     he   s always supported all my weird travel adventures and everything i remember when i first told them i wanted to start a company with my roommate  they didn   t know what was going to happen  but they were so  so  so supportive  then i went to vc and they were really supportive  they   ll send me articles  right  because they   re my parents  the articles will change depending on whatever i   m doing and they   re researching all the time  which is so nice of them  my mom         when i told her i wanted to do open source stuff she   s like     i don   t know what this is  but i   m reading about it all the time     i was like     oh my god  you   re reading about open source  what  do you even         even my friends here don   t know what it is     it   s been really  really awesome to have that level of support from my parents  and with friends         i think the friends i keep over time are friends who understand my kookiness a little bit  even within tech and stuff  so they   ve all been really great and supportive  i think that   s one of the most important things is  just having people around you who believe in you yeah  for sure  how do you feel about the state of tech in       what excites you  even particularly in open source  what frustrates you i   m so curious what is going to happen in the future  chuckles   everyone is obviously talking about         i don   t want to say the word  but         bubbles  but it   s kind of funny  so the short time that i was in venture  was apparently  now looking at the charts  one of the peak times in spending  so no wonder i thought it was fucking nuts  and last quarter  spending dropped like crazy  so  i can   t tell from the outside necessarily what is going on  but my friends i   ve talked to have said yeah  we   re investing way less  we   re examining things a lot more carefully  and so it   s kind of like  man  i wonder what it   s like to be in venture now  so  yeah  but i think  my theory is  it   s very hard to think long term about an industry that has a short history  my theory is the world has periods of high high growth and periods of figuring out how to sustain that growth  like grappling with whatever we   ve done  and so maybe right now we   ve passed through the hyper hyper growth periods and now we   re thinking about how to sustain things  and so  i mean  there   s plenty of politics around all this stuff  but there   s more talk about nonprofits and funding long term research and partnerships and initiatives that are reaching across certain sectors  and we   re talking about basic income and it   s not a joke anymore  that   s so cool i   m really excited about maybe potentially we   re entering this time where people are thinking a little bit more around sustainability and ensuring these long term things are around  that we can help fund creativity  i feel like creativity itself has been so validated as the power of the individual to make significant contributions which is why stuff like basic income doesn   t seem crazy  i mean it should be crazy  i think it   s just so funny that people are into basic income because other things sound like socialism or communism to them but then it   s like     oh  no  basic income is great     and it   s partially because we believe in people  i think it   s a really cool time right now because that   s what i believe and i really hope that more people invest in it and care about it the one thing that bothers me right now or feels weird is just all politics and conversations getting more polarized than it was before  and i   ve definitely noticed this about diversity conversations in tech  where i can   t even take part in them  it   s just really frustrating because i think that there   s two philosophies around diversity  one is around hyper polarization and separation into different shells  like     i   m black and you   re not     or     i   m a woman and you   re not  you can   t understand me  you can   t possibly understand me     that   s one school of thought and the other school of thought is more around things like unconscious bias where it   s like     we   re all sexist  we   re all racist     we   re all scared and vulnerable and know what it feels like to be rejected on whatever level  and so use that as a uniting  empathic connection  obviously  i resonate more strongly with that camp  and i feel like it   s missing from the conversation around diversity  because diversity can be all about highlighting what makes you different from others  or it could be all about highlighting what   s common between us  i really hope that is part of the conversation  i   m not very optimistic that it is and that makes me kind of sad how do you think your background and life experiences impact the way that you approach your work and what you want in work hyper collaboration  chuckles   i just believe that positive communication is the key to everything  or people just being able to trust each other and be vulnerable with each other is the key to everything  i think that maybe is why building support networks and stuff doesn   t feel unusual to me  because it is just a natural part of that         of building trust with somebody else  you honor them and their willingness to trust you  and you expect likewise  i think that   s just a really powerful currency and a way of just communicating with people and making people happy  it   s the most  most important thing of anything i do with work  making sure that i have other people   s trust and confidence and that i don   t ever violate that  that people feel welcome and included and no one ever feels shitty because i think those emotions are so universal  everything we do can kind of be boiled down to     do i feel shitty and rejected for who i am  or not     i   ve felt that in so many different ways growing up and i never want to inflict that on anybody else sounds like a very good quality for a founder or vc to have yes  or a person where do you see yourself in five to ten years  do you think you   ll still be here maybe  it   s hard to plan that far ahead  i   d like to be a little more flexible  and travel  but this still feels like my home for sure  i don   t know  i really suck at thinking far ahead for anything   chuckles  i kind of just think ahead to like the next year  as long as my bills get paid  and i   m having fun every day  then i know i   m in a good place what about this year  what are you like working on either yourself or for work right now it   s kind of a funny         i never really know how to explain what i   m doing right now  because i   m basically being supported by a foundation to bring more transparency to an issue that   s really important to technology  so i see sort of like the first half of this year just kind of being around getting people together  getting them talking  writing about open source so that it   s accessible  that helps bring some of those stories out of just within their communities and more to other people who might not have heard them  so that   s like a really important part of it  the reaction has been so much stronger than i expected  that   s a really positive thing  i feel like now it   s kind of time to also start thinking towards how can i help support that stuff long term  so thinking through like what would an organization look like that can help support and sustain  or just be a resource to people in those communities who need support or need help and there   s nowhere really like that right now  i think that   s the fun part that happens next as people get excited and engaged  the question is     what do we actually do about it    the last question  what advice would you have for people from similar backgrounds who are hoping to get into tech i   d say     people are just your best resource     i think that   s especially true in tech  and it   s especially true in silicon valley tech more than anywhere else where people are just so willing to help in this industry maybe more than anywhere else  i haven   t worked much in other industries but it just seems like it here  so if you don   t know how to do something or you want to learn how to do something  just cold email people and say hey  or go attend an event and introduce yourself to people  don   t be afraid to ask for help and then also give as freely as you receive  honestly like     of the work is just be nice and help people words from a techie turned freelance photographer  http   helenaprice
