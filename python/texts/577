 plans to charge for airpods  its new q tips  i mean  wireless headphones  they go on sale in october  and apple gave me a preproduction pair to try out along with the new iphone    which doesn   t come with a traditional headphone jack after using airpods in the office  on a plane and on a jog  listening to my tunes untethered  i   m smitten  i will really miss these little guys when i inevitably leave them on a plane  drop them in the toilet or watch as they tumble through a sidewalk grate now  what everyone else thinks about me for wearing airpods in public is a completely different matter  no other apple product in recent memory has been the source of so much hostility  to explain what   s actually good   and bad   about these new  misunderstood curiosities  let me answer the questions i   ve been getting all week     why did they get rid of the headphone jack   do i have to wear airpods now   apple removed the headphone jack to make space inside the slim iphone frame for stuff you may want more  like extra battery and a better camera  but you don   t have to use airpods to listen to music on the iphone    the phone still comes with a pair of corded headphones that plug into the flat lightning port  and an adapter so you can keep using your old headphones  too     why would i want to use airpods   earphones without wires really are pleasant  especially if you   re frequently on the move or in a tight spot like an airplane seat  and airpods are the simplest bluetooth headphones i   ve ever used  take them out of their case  and they   re on and ready to play music or take a call they also have a capability i now wish came with all headphones  pull one out of your ear and your music pauses on its own  put it back in your ear  and the music starts up again the airpods and a few models made by apple   s beats are the only headphones  so far  that use a new apple bluetooth wireless technology that makes it super quick to pair your headphones with your iphone  ipad  apple watch or mac  open the case that charges the airpods  and a menu pops up on any nearby devices that are associated with your icloud account     will they fit my ears   i have a handy test for you  take a pair of regular corded apple earbuds  officially known as earpods   shove them in your ear and shake vigorously  are they comfortable  the airpods are very nearly identical in size   just a tiny bit larger  i initially worried about them falling out  but have been pleasantly surprised they don   t     how do they sound   they sound a lot like regular earpods   pretty good for listening to pop music with bass  and for taking phone calls  they don   t have active noise cancellation  if you   re interested in that  i recommend the bose quietcomfort         can they work on my old iphone  the kind that actually had a headphone jack   yes  they work on all iphones going back to the iphone    but you   ll have to update your phone to ios        is siri involved   yes  you can double tap either airpod to summon the voice controlled assistant  who can pull up a song  change the volume and perform other tasks  we   re one step closer to the    hearable    computer in the movie    her     which starred the voice of  scarlett johansson     don   t they make you look like   a slick haired guy who also drives a bmw   the world can be a harsh judge of what   s new   and this product in particular reminds some of the bluetooth headsets that were popular last decade among people who spent way too much time on the phone  my colleague joanna says she worried the world was laughing at her when she wore them on a run once they   re in your ears  the airpods resemble a cross between earrings and electric toothbrush heads  if any company has the power to make something like that seem cool  it is apple     but if i wear these  will people not realize i   m listening to music and try to talk to me   yes  i found they   re not an effective deterrent for chit chatting colleagues and weirdos on the train     why do the airpods have those sticks at the end   nope  they aren   t for decoration  apple says the    stem    positions the built in microphones to better pick up speech   there is even an accelerometer in there to catch vibrations so the microphone knows when to focus on your voice  the stem also houses an antenna and battery     how long can airpods last on a single charge   i made it through an entire cross country flight with mine  apple says they can go five hours  and the charging case that comes with them can keep them going for up to        how do i charge the charging box   you use a lightning charger  like the iphone  the box comes with a cable  but no brick to plug into the wall     do they ever drop the connection or sound choppy   this has been a problem on some bluetooth headphones i   ve reviewed  and i experienced a few drop outs on my airpods outside   but they are preproduction units the challenge with bluetooth is that it can   t go through water  including the water in our heads  some other true wireless headphones have tried getting around this by using non bluetooth tech  the airpods stand out because the iphone beams to each one independently   audio doesn   t pass from one bud to the other     what if they get wet   unlike the iphone   and the new apple watch series two  the airpods aren t waterproof  my sweat didn   t seem to be a problem  but i haven   t had opportunity to use them in the rain     what if i lose the buds or the case   unfortunately  there isn   t a    find my airpods    app  the case is about the size of a box of dental floss  i   ve decided to get in the habit of always putting the case in one particular pocket in my backpack     what if someone on the street runs up and yanks one out of my ear   it is probably best not to chase down a criminal  just rest easy knowing your airpods are useless to a thief  they can   t be put back into setup mode or recharged without the case     can i share my airpods with my family   yes  airpods have to be associated with icloud accounts  but each pair can work with up to   of them  to add another person   s device  put the airpods in their case and press a setup button for a few seconds     why didn   t they call them airbuds   that would have been my suggestion  but alas  that title was already taken   by a classic      film about a basketball playing dog   write to geoffrey a  fowler at geoffrey fowler wsj com
