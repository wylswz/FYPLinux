portfolio minister men year over it gerstein fisher     are your names in the company i assume you re also the chief and founder and everything else     if three funds are there to are growth funds     ones or refund all top coral to court alphonse since inception     enduring to multifactor     investing which as i understand it     he led the research out there and which clues tendered that     good stock performance together the best cruise you can find you apply them in a methodical way     to the broad market comeuppance from stocks     is that enough on     to make money from a bomb i don t     that s actually not too bad i think i just change one word which is prediction verse observation     a lot of people the investment business focus on predicting the future     of the nice thing about quantitative investing more multifactor investing the way we do it     is that were actually using observation in the scientific process to determine how we invest     ultimately we have over a hundred years of data across many countries in security sets     to analyze the kinds of things are the factors that seem to do a good job driving returns across securities     now i mean we are building portfolios     you know really expecting these things to continue into the future     not only because they happened in the past but because there s a good economic framework for why they happened in the past and why we would expect out of this kind of correlation but also like a common sense reason these things are working apsel in in i ve told people before we can all go do you know the casino     and have a     negative recall related experience and still lose money on the idea around this style of observation and statistical analysis is to find things that have good economic frameworks for why they happen in the future let s talk about what you do and and and     i guess the clues they use to find good stocks of different accordion when you     roll stock value stocks     in a recent a refund     let s talk about growth stocks first because you focus on their into your funds     aam you said the warm the most important things to look for his price momentum and why should we buy stuff just the it s it s up it s going up     share one that a portfolio that has a lot of diversification for you on a large quantity of securities to very much a little bit like an index strategy in a way where you re not trying in a surly identified one company hoping to get that one right     but instead you re buying this big basket of securities     but instead of being completely neutral to the index across all factors you might decide to have a little more or less of these factors than the index in certain respects     the momentum is one of them     momentum is this idea and we use price momentum     up where we look at the change in prices across securities over a period of time let s say twelve months     any idea of having a little more exposure to securities that have grown faster than their peers     and a little bit of fuel or securities than those of a lost more than their peers that one     tilts to that factor momentum     has been quite a bit of evidence that they had a return premium to the flat benchmark over a longer is so don t be afraid of the high fliers but presumably you don t just wanna load up on highfliers has are flying high so when eu layer or what else to layer on top of some foreign after you can find surprise     well some research that we ve done recently that s been done out in the industry is the psyche of combining factor so you may have momentum in your growth exposure we get a little more momentum than you can dial that down in a certain way with other factors for example     traditional value measures now amongst growth stocks may be harder to use things like price to earnings or price to book     as earnings in both value are a little more ambiguous per se in growth stocks but there are the number of valuation measures you can use in growth stocks to dial down your momentum exposure to diversify michael     whelan example of that might be capital expenditures     you can wait securities for those companies that are investing very heavily in their businesses     a simple way to identify that is to look at their a change in their assets over a period of time     very often when companies have very high security prices where their businesses are doing well markets love them the prices are growing very high     their cost of capital is low in other words they can raise money in the market     at a very low cost     and what we find is management teams often make investments in projects that have a low expected outcome     because of your borrowing from the market a two percent you might take on a project that is expected to earn four percent     as compared to the security that may have a higher cost of capital because their price may not have been as high when it might have to borrow from the marketed five percent     there to be more careful about taking on projects that have an expected outcome of greater than five     c want to avoid companies actually better making large investments because their stock prices high and on investment is calm busy and is down the road some point battle turned earnings     that s the right to justice     going on real estate he mentioned earlier you look at net asset value is the key     the eu without value kids     for investors out there for looking for value stocks you dont wanna value fund for you were saying     you don t particularly like chasing after big dividend yields     aam and you think there are better measures out than just looking at low price to earnings ratio what s the best we can do in terms of measures to find value stops     so imagine savings value stocks and then reads um i think that ultimately     up investors especially today because of how low interest rates in our country and then     people are out there reaching for yield they re buying options they re buying dividend paying stocks they re ultimately building these non diversified portfolios just to get a little extra income     they end up with a portfolio tilted to things like financial services     alm or utilities because they re the ones that pay the dividends     and you re eliminating a large amount of other sectors and industries that may not pay dividends but could ultimately be great performing securities and sectors     so my suggestion the highest level is don t limit your portfolio to securities that high dividends relative to their prices in and there may be looked at that but you should also be looking at things like price to book ratios     price to cash flows price to earnings     he has a variety of other things     there is research that shows if you wanna buy value stocks in you can only take one thing     you probably better off using price to book then you would be priced in dividends in a world where you can only choose one thing     now the other thing with regards to real estate investing     the gerstein fisher multi factor global real estate portfolio we run a global reach strategy     they re one of the factors that we look at which also relates to choosing stocks with valuation as     we try to avoid the real estate securities that have a lot of leverage     it s a simple ranking where you can rank all retreated by how much leverage they have been the kind of leverage is a short or long     what we have found is a portfolio of real estate securities with less leverage then the benchmark     is a better real estate portfolio     is both on a risk and return point of you got it all this talk about factors has me excited amerigo screen for some companies
