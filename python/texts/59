bullpen capital is underway on fund ii  and this week i had to update my linkedin profile  i   m now a partner at a venture capital firm on sand hill road  i can   t say i ever expected this  since my career hasn   t exactly followed a normal trajectory  i   ve bagged groceries  mopped bathrooms  and carried golf bags  i had a   year stint as a professional poker player  i   ve worked in science  education  and law  but somehow i ended up in silicon valley investing in startups i keep getting asked    how did you get to be a vc     and frankly i don   t know the answer to that question yet  this wasn   t some grand scheme culminating in promotion  it was some combination of luck  hustle  and sleep deprivation  what i do know  however  is there are some rules i   ve lived by that helped me get here  if your parents are stanford business professors or you   re reading this from your country club you probably don   t need my advice  but for the troublemakers out there trying to break into the business  here goes i missed my high school prom as a punishment for my first computer hack i publicly asked an    year old judge from the federal circuit out on a date i told a dirty joke in an elevator to my future boss  now partner  paul martino over a decade ago whatever i was  i wasn   t easy to forget it took me    years to call up paul  but when i said    hey  this is james  we met in an elevator in san jose in              he knew exactly who was on the other end of the phone  sometimes you   ll be remembered for all the wrong reasons  ask me about my steve case story   but when it goes well your network can grow full of powerful people who have your back when i applied at bullpen  the team reviewed about     candidates for the entry level analyst job  some of the candidates had founded and sold their own startups  had     years experience in finance  or were stanford mbas with     gpas i didn   t have that kind of pedigree  and i was frankly just too stupid to know what i was up against         but i did have some grit and work ethic from grinding blue collar jobs to get through school  so i simply started working for the firm the best i could  without pay and without permission  the team artfully ignored me for the most part  but when the final interview round included an analysis component  the  admittedly inelegant  manually typed  database i built for myself eventually supported the thing that mattered most to the bullpen guys     your analysis was simply better    so don   t be intimidated by the competition  work your ass off  mop floors at sequoia if you have to  and realize that if you play the game right the ivy league mbas don   t always win at every stage in life  there will be pressure to conform  fight it  if you play it too safe  you won   t create any enemies  but you won   t find your best allies either  keep being you  step out of line  be opinionated  be someone that can   t be easily ignored strive to quickly be either glorified or vilified  because that   s the fastest way to find the mentors and career opportunities that reward you for being who you are  instead of trying to beat you into some pre designed mold education is important  don   t get me wrong  but this is a people business and your perfect gpa will get stale pretty soon after graduation  skip enough classes to make an impression on the people who inspire you  be the person at happy hour making your colleagues laugh  not grinding away in your cubicle after hours hoping they notice your hard work i   m not saying you shouldn   t work extra to get ahead  but do it when no one   s looking and do it for your own curiosity and ambition  not to gain favor with your boss as the junior guy it   s easy to keep the training wheels on and let your partners take the lead  and you usually should because they   re smarter than you          but don   t get complacent  when you see an opportunity to step up and behave like a partner level guy  get tenacious if you fail  at least you proved you had the guts to take the initiative  if you succeed  you might jump a few years ahead on your career path if you work with startups everyday as an investor  you   re lucky to be here  don   t forget that  the emotional swings facing every entrepreneur are difficult to bear  and when you   re on the side with all the money it can be tempting to become too full of yourself  don   t be that guy be transparent  make quick decisions  and respect the entrepreneur   s time as much as you respect your own the moment you stop learning is the moment you become obsolete  and there   s a pack of really bright young men and women  and at least one guy i know in his   s  who will gladly relieve you of your job if you don   t give it the respect it deserves stay hungry  and i   ll see you out there  let   s do a deal together soon poker professional turned venture capitalist  likes card tables  tech start ups  and inflection points  partner
