us and     from wall st     i     it s amazing     i     to your street     this is your money matters from the wall street     the     welcome to your money matters i and charlie turner in new york     in advance of the quarterly earnings season companies typically issued guidance about what the results might be ill     but they ve been rather tight lipped ahead of the upcoming third quarter reporting period     and you could probably sum up the reason in three words the presidential election     let s talk for the wall street journal s steve russolillo     steve you break that september is usually a light month for companies issuing guidance but the last month was a record correct     yeh that s correct so i you know earnings season is kicking off this week and     what are the things that we look down ahead of the reporting period was     just what sort of     how the company s been reacting the way business is not really reacting to head of the that the present selection so one one metric that we look that as company guidance so what are what outlooks where companies saying about their future how their future results what they think they re for future results are going to intel     and so if you think back to the last reporting period you know where it thinking about now second half outlooks which included     november which include the presidential election and so     i ve the fund the really interesting thing that we found was in september which is the month of the the end of the third quarter     but is more important for the story goes as the month before earnings season kicks off     that stupidly late month for companies just historically general to give guidance we know that from historical trends but the really interesting thing now is that     very very few copies action a record low number of companies gave corporate guidance in september     so what is that mean that means that     come easy just were not willing to step up to the plate and say we here s what we think about our business here was so we think about our industry here s the thing about our sector     leading into the presidential     one victory behind a corporate reticence is the companies are reluctant to give guidance until they know how the presidential election will turn out giving them a better idea of what sort of policies the new president will propose     coveted oh one issue forecast a could turn out to be wrong right exactly yet so you know what to look     you look bad by saying one thing and then the apus it plays out and so     what another thing that s really interesting about this is that companies in general this is part of the larger trend here the thomas  election related but     the larger trend of companies that are just     as fewer and fewer copies actually giving out well right i was sorta surprised when i saw the     because i have to confess i was surprised to find out the companies were still issuing guys try to write because it well past bad experiences with companies doing that     right right now it s a great point in with and it s interesting too because they re so there s two trends that play here one is that     just you and your cubbies are giving guidance but     you know perhaps more should be because i yell as     as one of its treasures that talks over bank of america merrill lynch said     she said that you know they ve done numerous studies looking at companies  stock prices     based on whether a company gives guidance versus whether it doesn t     and she calls it that there s a quote transparency premium the pleas on the markets which basically means that     the company is on average they     tend to give guidance     typically have a higher stock market valuation     in companies that don t so basically indices over warding more and more information that s out there in the marketplace which is what they now look is supposed to do     on the other hand     companies that issued negative guidance right to get her right exactly and so     exactly see that if the company warns about the results stock price takes a hit but the to the point that she was making know is that even in those negative situations     the fact that this is more information more transparency     tends to get rewarded by the market ended in a country that does     and it s not just numbers     that they would throw out in this guidance is it s also plans exactly is adds a great point to because there s a lot of it depending on the     the the the data provider that you use it gets and if the numbers here about who s giving guidance and who is in and     pasted bankamerica maryland said wilson wouldn t be scared span across the board did anyway that s talking all about the features and so take it doesn t the same need to be a numerically focused     on outlook but it could just be in oh so though the words that are saying about the future and how they think their businesses can and     do it in the future that s also part of its capital spending plans etc to that of which were concerned about because     not too many businesses are     popping their capital spending business investment and it is been way down over the past several quarters of the big trend for sure     how they do this so i know they have a conference call when the issue the actual earnings numbers what about a     what about guidance to the do they hold a press conference or a conference call on the phone so the lazy that there s two ways typically     a company in its earnings statement could put out some fort overlooking guidance that that that gives the us objections in there     in the press release and then also on an earnings call seeing its companies that don t necessarily put anything in their in their press release but they will talk about in the earnings call which is usually     the company reports in the afternoon     sons earnings calls later that afternoon or sometimes this the following morning     it s in the third of its reporting the morning usually the earnings call will be a little bit late     right so again by merrill lynch s count does pass september only twenty one essen p five hundred companies issued earnings guidance in september     and     it s a record low for any month it s a record low end and maybe they attributed to the present selection the said bus and you know september usually     companies that tend to typically don t say much in september because october is when the reporting period really starts to that so we see this week     alcoa kicks off on tuesday     then we get     the re banks reporting on friday so and then add the the week or two after that that s really when     earnings season really really kicks off but     but when you go back to september though so usually cummings don t say much but even in that with that context companies have said much much less     this past september than they usually do can we attribute this and i probably should mass this because it s probably no proper     can we attribute this to the donald trump of fact we really don t know what s gonna happen i mean not that i would guess that it is certainly a big role playing in this that i mean     you know that the it that it s a wild card race i mean we just don t know no one knows if he s elected what s going to happen and so     if your company why would you try to project in that sector     wall street journal reporter steve bruce a little thank you very much for being on the podcast thank so much and that s this edition of
