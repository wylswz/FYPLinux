 pixar and nasa   but it does away with many things we associate with traditional speakers  like remote controls and speaker wires  instead  cone streams all of its music over wi fi  selecting from a buffet of music on the streaming service rdio   a     per month subscription is required  it also plays podcasts on stitcher and tracks you can beam directly from apple devices using airplay cone feels intimate because most of your communication is physical   you touch it and talk to it primarily  rather than controlling it via remote or mobile device  to change what cone plays  you turn a ring around the edge of its speaker like a dial   the larger the spin  the more different your next selection will be  to request a specific artist  song or album  press and hold a button in the center of the speaker and then speak  the hardware is as sleek and button free as anything unveiled by  steve jobs it also talks back to you like r  d   emitting tones and changing the color of its central button   blue for  i m listening   and red for  i m sorry geoff  i m afraid i can t do that  there s also a free app for iphones that lets you control the cone  typing in searches for song or artist  selecting a favorite song or seeing which songs it played recently  but this is just a supplement to cone s physical controls  for when you need to fine tune your relationship behind the scenes  cone is learning about you  if that idea gives you the willies  it s worth knowing that cone goes a step further than what we ve become accustomed to with personalized internet based music services like pandora  it takes note when you turn its dial to change songs  but also records context like the time of day  the volume at which you play a song and even where in your house the speaker sits  based on the strength of the wi fi signal  this is the direction our always on technology is heading  it s about learning habits as much as predicting taste cone uses a lot of the latest technology to trick you into believing it can think  but at least in the prereleased version of cone that i tested  the pieces don t quite come together the speaker s audio quality is just ok  too often  songs cut out for a millisecond or are accompanied by a rumble  as if the speaker had digestive problems  perhaps caused by its shaky wi fi connectivity  cone doesn t sound as rich as the similarly sized      play   speaker from sonos  this may be because the pricier cone comes with an eight hour battery so you can move it around  while the sonos speaker must remain plugged in  at least cone sounds better than the portable      beats pill xl cone can t do some of the basic things we ve come to expect from wireless speakers  you can t stream bluetooth audio to it like you can with pill  which means you can t take it with you on a picnic in the park  you also can t make it part of an all home audio system like sonos commanding cone with your voice works for simple songs and artists  but can be frustrating  when i asked to hear swedish electro pop singer robyn  cone kept giving me anything but   robin thicke  and another female artist named  robin mckelle  when i said   play r o b y n   cone played a stand up comedy routine about an ob gyn and then there s the challenge of building a relationship with cone to hear the music you actually want  automated taste recommendations have been around for nearly two decades  with notable successes like amazon s book suggestions and  netflix s

 movie preference engine  but cone puts itself way out there by not only suggesting content  but actually choosing what to play cone works best for people who already have rdio accounts  they ve already provided tons of valuable information about their tastes  it may support other streaming services in the future it can t yet take more open ended commands like   play something relaxing   or even  play classical music   it doesn t yet incorporate the tastes of two or more people at home who like different stuff  either  cone has no way of knowing who is listening  without an ability to differentiate  it fails the relationship test in real life i didn t previously use rdio  so cone and i started with a blank slate  things seem to get off on the wrong foot after i allowed cone to play several indie rock titles  it kept trying to play artists like vampire weekend to please me  but i m more into beyonc    to correct it  i d turn the dial until something i liked came up  but sometimes i d step away and it would bring back mumford   sons  getting cone to get you takes time and effort  its makers say it should figure you out after a few weeks  so i set out to counterprogram cone s false assumptions  i started using it several hours a day   and even named it tabitha  on cone s iphone app  i gave favorite  hearts  to macklemore and  sara bareilles to nudge it in the right direction  i d regularly pick up cone and command   play rihanna  one morning last week  i woke up and turned on cone  it played news headlines from npr  followed by beyonc   and jay z s  drunk in love  finally  cone got me  then it played a country song  clearly we need some relationship counseling    write to geoffrey fowler at geoffrey fowler wsj com and  geoffreyfowler on twitter
