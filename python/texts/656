articles jimi hendrixs electric lady studios turns               on august            jimi hendrix threw open the doors to electric lady studios  his greenwich village recording studio  to a group of musicians and friends  named for the jimi hendrix experience album electric ladyland  the studio looked like a new orleans pleasure house embedded in a psychedelic space capsule   patti smith was at the opening party  along with ronnie wood   eric clapton and steve winwood  all would go on to record there  hendrix saw smith sitting on the steps that night  like a    hick wallflower     she wrote in her memoir just kids  and told her he wanted electric lady to be a place where artists of all kinds would record the    abstract universal language of music     three weeks later  hendrix died in a london apartment after ingesting an excess of barbiturates  he was    years old miraculously  his vision survived him  from its inception  his mother ship served as a rock  funk  disco and soul olympus where gold and platinum hits were forged  in the      s  led zeppelin   stevie wonder  lou reed  the rolling stones and blondie all recorded there  it was electric lady where two members of a raw  young band called wicked lester laid down demos in       they would return as kiss to record dressed to kill  in        john lennon and  david bowie strolled in and improvised the number one single    fame     for bowie   s young americans album  that same year  smith recorded her first album  horses  there  and a couple of years later  nile rodgers arrived with his band chic and recorded the multiplatinum single    le freak     the enchantment held through the      s and      s  as ac dc and the clash showed up  then billy idol  the cars  weezer and santana  the house that jimi built welcomed them all forty five years later  electric lady still stands  its block of west  th street now houses a medical clinic  a frozen yogurt shop and a goodwill store  but keen eyed observers will spot a groovy  oval mirrored door tucked amid the workaday storefronts  a glass wall with silvery bubble letters bearing the studio   s name and  behind it  dark velvet curtains  within  the lady   s multigenerational family rocks on  recording  mixing  performing or frolicking on the roof at barbecues  open any door in the past five years  and you might have seen daft punk laying down tracks for random access memories  winner of the      grammy for album of the year    bono and adele chatting with interns  or jay z and the edge dancing with an engineer   s mom  u  took over the top floor to cut their latest album  songs of innocence   keith richards came in to record an expanded version of some girls in       in july  he chose the studio as the place to give a first listen to his new solo album  crosseyed heart   the star british mixing engineer tom elmhirst has taken up permanent residence in studio c  where last year he mixed beck   s morning phase  winner of the      grammy for album of the year  on one day last winter  seven sessions proceeded simultaneously  including  interpol in studio a  jon batiste  the bandleader for the late show with  stephen colbert  in studio b   s live room  and  lana del rey  rod stewart and producer and singer guitarist dan auerbach of the black keys all working on the third floor     this place is a beating heart  it   s got its own rhythm     says elmhirst yet only a little over a decade ago  the lady nearly vanished  the music industry was in a downward spiral  the studio   s infrastructure was deteriorating  and    months went by without a single booking     the place was almost on its back     remembers the architect  john storyk  who was    when he designed the studio in       it was his second official commission  hendrix took a chance on him  impressed by a soho nightclub storyk had designed called cerebrum   mark ronson  who frequented the studio at the turn of the millennium  during the    soulquarian    period  when the roots  d   angelo and erykah badu recorded there  thought its    glory days era had sort of ended     hendrix   s estate had sold the studio in       and it changed hands again  in       the owners thought they   d have to close it down one freezing new york night in february  a gaggle of partygoers were buzzed into the studio for a party to toast electric lady   s legacy  descending a steep staircase  they emerged into an underground parlor with persian carpets  chesterfield sofas  fringed lamps and  everywhere you looked  speakers  consoles and recording equipment  a mural painted by the california artist lance jost curved around the subterranean walls  depicting an intergalactic spacecraft where blond astronymphs perched by broad windows  admiring the floating universe  this was the fabled studio a   which looks virtually the same as it did back in the day  says storyk  a wiry  tattooed guy in a knit cap and cowboy boots broke the nostalgic spell as he started to address the crowd  for a moment  he looked like pinkman  aaron paul   s character in breaking bad  or  on second glance  a sound engineer  about to say     check  check        but then he began speaking  in earnest  southern inflected tones  his name  he said  was lee foster  he was from tennessee  and as he described the transformation of the studio over the past    years   the resuscitation of moldering floorboards and dated equipment and the slow return of the rock pantheon   it became clear that he was the protector of this monument to music   s golden age     i will say this without a doubt     says  eric kaplan  counsel to the family who gave foster the reins in       and who have always retained anonymity      without lee foster  electric lady would have died     since       foster has been the studio   s general manager  partner and minority equity owner auerbach  who launched his new band  the arcs  in studio a in june  says     since lee   s been here  it   s started to form into something more like what the founders had in mind     devendra banhart  who feels such blood brotherhood with foster that he inked him with a tattoo at the studio  says     lee was the person who single handedly reanimated electric lady     to ronson  most of whose hit      album  uptown special  was mixed at the studio  foster    made it somewhere that musicians and creative people and singers want to be  he feels like one of us     so how did a kid from tennessee end up with the keys to jimi hendrix   s spaceship  sitting in his upstairs office   a fender telecaster signed by keith richards       to lee  one love  kr      leans against a wall   foster      reminisces about his upbringing in smithville  on a farm    miles from nashville  his father was a wildlife supervisor and his mother was a schoolteacher  the first song he remembers hearing is    mammas don   t let your babies grow up to be cowboys     playing on an alarm clock in his parents    bedroom  when he was    growing up he never considered a career in music     we were told     boys pick up a rake  girls can do that froufrou stuff         the summer that foster was    a neighbor  the country singer john anderson  brought  elton john   s longtime lyricist  bernie taupin  to the fosters    house for a supper of crowder peas and frog legs  a snapshot shows taupin standing in the living room  his arm on the boy   s shoulder  young lee looks downward  smiling and shy  he didn   t know that  while he was chasing hens and riding mules  ac dc was mixing back in black at the music studio     miles away that would become his home  like him  ac dc had to buck the doubters     i   m just not hearing any hits on this album     a record exec told the group  according to electric lady lore  it became one of the top    best selling albums of all time at     foster enrolled at middle tennessee state university to study to be a rural vet  unmotivated and frustrated  he coasted and flailed until he met a blond blues singer on the quad     she was my penny lane     foster says  referring to the character in the movie almost famous who introduces a wide eyed novice to the rock    n    roll scene  he hadn   t realized mtsu had a music school until she walked him across campus and showed him     it was like the world opened up     he remembers  switching majors  he discovered jimi hendrix  got a white strap guitar and  in his senior year  landed a three month unpaid internship at electric lady  selling a baby blue mustang he   d fixed up to pay his way  when he got to the studio  expecting a hub of creativity  he found a place in the doldrums  not only was it    depressing     but    it hurt me to see such a monument being run the way it was     demoralized  he went home to tennessee after the internship ended  he had a standing offer to return to electric lady  but    given the state of things    was reluctant to accept it by the fall of       when he couldn   t find work in nashville   s music industry  he started to fester and float  soon an old smithville friend  tim pack  intervened  driving to the house where foster was staying  pack told him to get in the pickup and took him to his home on nearby short mountain  for the next nine months  the men worked from dawn to dusk  landscaping  mowing and painting houses  and tending    calves pack had bought to raise and sell in the spring     his point was to show me what i would be doing for the rest of my life if i stopped now     foster says  choking up at night he and pack would meet on the porch  smoke and talk  and foster would fret about whether to return to electric lady  as the weather grew cold and wet  the calves got pneumonia     they were dying  and we   d bury them  their little hooves were stickin    out of the mud  it was just really dark     foster says  one night  pack snapped when foster again began his agonizing and    i hate to say it  just kinda whining     as pack puts it  bouncing himself back and forth across the door frame in imitation of foster   s indecision     he said     watch this     and he walks out into the dark     foster recalls  three days later pack drove foster to the atlanta train station     before he let me out of the car  tim says     tell me three things you   re gonna accomplish in new york         foster thought and answered         i   m gonna take over the management of electric lady  i   m gonna make a record with ryan adams and i   m gonna smoke a cigarette with keith richards     i hugged him  got on the train and     hours on  here i was again   ready for act two     foster headed straight for electric lady with his suitcases  the gates were locked  a technician showed up at   a m  and  seeing him camped out on the sidewalk  hollered     electric lady and the tramp     once foster made it inside the doors  he was surprised by what he found  after the soulquarians had departed  the place had gone further downhill     electric lady was like a sick human being     he says     it was pale gray and gaunt and tired     his voice rises with indignation as he recalls     someone had taken a jimi hendrix calendar  cut out the photos and put them up in cheap plastic frames     he pauses     to me it felt like the building was being neglected     three weeks later  the technician quit  on a morning when a local radio station had booked radiohead into studio a to perform two concerts  the second of which would be relayed live  after the first performance  the isdn line went down  there was no way to transmit the second show  refusing to give up  foster had a board mix put together of the first performance and cabbed it to the radio station  the show aired as scheduled  the next day  foster was made operations manager  he was     alone in new york  and had nobody to turn to for advice reverting to what he knew   carpentry  painting and plumbing  foster began to overhaul the building  working around the clock  he slept in the studio  using piano covers for blankets  at      a m   he would wake up  walk around the neighborhood and return when it was time to open the doors  kaplan took notice     you could see he looked at  the studio as  if it was a temple     says kaplan     you couldn   t kick him out     less than two years later  kaplan made foster studio manager and gave him a year to get the studio back on its feet         make it work or we   re gonna have to shut the doors     he told me     says foster after he fixed up the place  foster still could not lure musicians in to record  he started going to downtown clubs where the strokes  the yeah yeah yeahs and ryan adams were playing  talking up the new  improved lady and getting to know the crews  for months  every time he saw adams   s guitar tech  he begged him to tell the rocker he would get a free day at the studio  no response and then  one morning in       at   a m  foster woke to a phone call  it was adams     hey  you remember you said you   d give me that free session     adams asked     i   m here now         we were probably good and tanked     adams says now     the bars close around then      foster rushed to electric lady and let him in  that day adams recorded the song    two     he was impressed by the vintage analog equipment foster had installed in the control room   previously  adams had recorded at    this little awful studio    on   th street that was digital only     not my thing    over the next nine months  adams cut the album easy tiger  and he and foster became buddies     lee is family to me     adams says  after word of adams   s stay got out  patti smith booked in to record her      album  twelve  and found she liked the revitalized studio     lee is constantly taking care of things technologically and making sure people are happy     she says  the industry took notice     all of a sudden     foster says     bowie   s back  elvis costello is here  clapton   s here     around that time  hollywood came calling  a scout needed a location for the movie  nick and norah   s infinite playlist  the director and producer were so enthralled by their tour that they wrote electric lady into the script  the music industry was still floundering  and yet  says andrew miano  a producer of the film  foster    placed the studio back in the discussion of where to record  mix or make your album     soon  a new generation of performers arrived  including m i a   kanye west and haim in       foster decided he wanted to take over the studio himself  kaplan gave him his blessing to find a new owner  and storyk introduced foster to a music loving private equity fund manager named keith stoltz  who respected the hendrix legacy and had a passion for vinyl records  after the two met  stoltz bought the business   on condition that foster continue to run it  together they expanded the studio space and staff and formed electric lady artist management in       foster and his nashville associate kirby lee now represent four emerging groups   nikki lane  hurray for the riff raff  clear plastic masks and mechanical river  that same year  electric lady co founded an annual festival at  willie nelson   s texas ranch called heartbreaker banquet  this spring   mick jagger dropped by  after hbo greenlit a series he and  martin scorsese had sold  about a young music executive in the      s  afterward  hbo booked studio a for three months  and this august  foster launches the concert series    live at electric lady    and announces the electric lady records label  which will release    inch lps of the performances  as well as seven inch records under the heading    generation club     foster says     i want to show people we   re not just a studio    to mark electric lady   s   th anniversary  patti smith inaugurates the live series  performing her entire first album  horses  in studio a  where she recorded the original in       the concert will be pressed onto the debut electric lady studios lp  this was her idea     it occurred to me that it might be nice to perform it there  as a gift to lee     she says  in    all the configurations i   ve played there     she says     having lee has been the best experience for us all  he has made me feel like it   s a home    one day not so long ago  bernie taupin booked time at electric lady to work on a new elton john album  he had long forgotten the little kid he   d met in tennessee  but the kid remembered him  calling his dad  foster asked him to mail the smithville snapshot to new york  when taupin arrived  foster walked into the control room and handed him the photo     he looks at it  looks at me  and says     why do you have this  i haven   t seen that in    years         foster smiled     i said     that is me you   re hugging     all this has come full circle
