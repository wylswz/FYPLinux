articles heart like a levee by hiss golden messenger review           though he   s always been a singer songwriter worthy of praise and attention   m c  taylor both alters and ups his game with    heart like a levee     the new album by his band hiss golden messenger  it arrives on friday what   s new begins with the music  along with brothers brad and  phil cook  bassist and multi instrumentalist  respectively  who are members of the band megafaun  and drummer  matt mccaughan of bon iver  the    year old mr  taylor nudges hiss golden messenger   s sound away from the alt country side of americana heard on its previous recordings toward the rich soul of the south embodied by recordings made in memphis  tenn   and muscle shoals  ala   in the     s and      s the follow up to the band   s         lateness of dancers     which nods to  j j  cale and  bob dylan in its country rock sway     heart like a levee    has a lyrical theme that its music supports well  in early       on tour behind    lateness of dancers     mr  taylor felt far from his family and home  and found himself questioning whether he was meeting his responsibilities by staying on the road in support of his music  exacerbating his sense of uncertainty was the reality that  for the first time in two decades  he was without a day job  mr  taylor  who earned a graduate degree in folklore from the university of north carolina at chapel hill  had given up a position in which he traveled the state to make field recordings of people playing traditional music throughout last year  he sketched new songs that revisited his emerging theme  from his home in durham  n c   in mid september  mr  taylor said by phone that the words to    heart like a levee    ultimately became an exploration of his self confidence and an understanding of what he is trying to achieve with his life and career  on the album  which he produced with  brad cook  he places his lyrics on a bed of uncluttered instrumental arrangements that  as he said  put    very little mediation between the voice and the spirit     mr  taylor said his music began to achieve its focus with    bad debt     a      solo    unplugged    album     that was the time when i pared away all the distractions  what are the things i can do  not because i   m technically brilliant  but what is the    it    i can do     on that record it emerged that he can frame his musings on weighty issues in a song  several on the self reflective album are akin to prayers     he loves us all but those who fall hold a special place in his ranks   least i hope this is how it goes since i   m just about out of breath     he sings in     jesus shot me in the head    since       hiss golden messenger has released a series of recordings that confirm mr  taylor   s gifts as vocalist and composer  he   s a veteran concert performer  too  in late       he lit up    late show with  david letterman    with    southern grammar     a funky  horn fed song that was the title track of an      ep     oh my god     effused mr  letterman     i loved everything about this  this is all you need right here      the video of the performance is on youtube   displaying its ability to do well by other songwriters  hiss golden messenger also participated in the mammoth      grateful dead tribute album    day of the dead     contributing a snappy reading of the jerry garcia robert hunter song    brown eyed women    the sounds of the american south inform    heart like a levee      and not only the kind of lilting  soulful organ and piano played in the      s and      s by  barry beckett or spooner oldham on sessions recorded at fame studios in muscle shoals or by  isaac hayes or  booker t  jones at the stax studios in memphis  while an electric piano ushers in    as the crow flies    and a gospel meets rock piano is the foundation of    ace of cups hung low band     mr  taylor   s latest compositions are enriched by such touchstone sounds as the mandolin and banjo in the sing along title track   matt douglas   s slinky tenor saxophone on    highland grace     and the guitars in    like a mirror loves a hammer     one of which calls to mind some of joe south   s work     happy day  sister my sister     is a soulful folk tune  several songs are lifted by choir like harmonies in which mr  taylor is accompanied by tift merritt  sonyia turner and mountain man   s alexandra sauser monnig rising from a platform of self doubt but fortified by mr  taylor   s appreciation for the traditional and his modest sense of adventure     heart like a levee    unfolds as a warm  often understated but powerful recording  it provides an enjoyable ride through an exploration of a style of american music that always seems to reward appreciation   mr  fusilli is the journal   s rock and pop music critic  email him at jfusilli wsj com and follow him on twitter  wsjrock
