   the    new basement tapes    project was    a great opportunity to meet some demons for me and stomp them in the head       
 how did you pick the songs  i had this long list  t bone had tweaked it in a couple of places   not that dolly parton song  this one  the one he chose     don   t let it trouble your mind     was less folky than the one on my list  the one i chose     gypsy joe and me     is basically a ballad  so sad and so beautiful  i think his was ultimately the right choice  it was such a powerhouse of a song  it was just so upbeat  we needed that upbeat feel because there   s plenty of weight on the record already  how did you approach your song interpretations   i   d go in with the list and most of the time  we   d start the day listening to the youtube of some of the originals and see what felt right  i have different voices in my body  it   s me  but it   s different aspects of my voice  with    o love is teasing     we listened to the eeriness of  jean ritchie   s dulcimer playing and we said     how can we capture that without copying     i had a feel of how i wanted to do it going in and we had to decide how much we wanted to push the drama element  and of course we had different instrumentations  we took the way she sang as a launchpad  sometimes it came together  snap  and sometimes it was a journey  this one was a journey  how did you decide on the final mix  we recorded    or    songs  when     of the process was done  we realized we didn   t have an album  we had a collection of songs  t bone and i wanted an album  to me  they   re related by being americana  based on the music of strong women  but to modern ears they needed more cohesion  a narrative of some sort  we needed a beginning  we went back and forth and that   s when we found    last kind words    by  geeshie wiley  that   s when we knew we had an album   what made that song the glue  it was a song that had been around in my universe  when t bone suggested that one  it was like a bolt from the heavens  i was like     that   s it     we did it in like three takes  honestly  when we did it  it just felt right nobody knows about this woman  geeshie wiley  she sang in the     s and   s and disappeared into the ether  it feels good to start with her and to end with my story  my experience  it felt like a bold statement  saying if you don   t like what we   re doing with this record  you better get out now   were you ever intimidated by the power of the originals  no  i was inspired by them  there   s a big difference  the originals should be launchpads   you never want to sweep it all out it   s where being a classical musician and a folk musician complement each other  as a classical musician  you have to sing every note  follow the music as it is written  you are really handicapped in how to make it your own  as a folk musician  you have more room to do that  there can be no specter of dolly parton or geeshie wiley when you go in the booth  you   re in the booth and you have to be the punch line  it has to be you  otherwise there   s no point  what have been the most important facets of your collaboration with t bone burnett  he has such a deep knowledge  he   ll pull a song out of nowhere  i   ll be like     where did you get this song and why didn   t i know about it     he wants to dig into the crevices of american music and bring it out and i   m totally behind that  the main thing he wanted me to remember is that each song is a story  every vocal flourish has to enhance the emotion of the story and not be because you want to show off your voice  that   s usually the dialogue we had  where was the story and how can it be best told  how did your participation in the    basement tapes    project help you grow as an artist  it was a great opportunity to meet some demons for me and stomp them in the head   these things that kind of lurk in your psyche  when you   re in an experience like that  it really lays it open  you   re expected to create  to work with people you don   t know  to make something great  i felt like t bone was bringing me into this thing and i wanted to justify his faith in me  i was not a songwriter  i   m a mother who had just weaned her son and was leaving my family for the first time in a long time  i   d been in a black string band for    years it   s one of the hardest things i   ve ever done   ever  everyone involved just wanted the music to win  t bone and elvis were all bringing their a game  their a plus game  they were leaving their ego at the door  i learned so much about how i work  you have to be willing to step it down and be willing to suck  now i   m incredibly proud of the music i wrote  i   m going to be chewing on it for a long time   how does your conservatory training inform your folk interpretations  does it ever hinder you when you   re reaching for something grittier  no i have pretty much gotten good at letting it go   all the nights of singing string band music     round about the mountain    was the hardest  we were taking a spiritual which had been made into a classical piece and taking it back to a vernacular piece   you   re going to a desert island and can only bring one instrument  what is it  oh god  that   s hard  how long am i going to be on this desert island  five years ago  i   d have said fiddle  today  i   d probably say banjo  i   ve had a love affair all over again with the minstrel banjo   what songs do you sing to your children  are they musical  my kids are   and almost   and sometimes they   re like     stop singing  mommy     but my daughter  the older one  loves all my songs and now she   s singing stuff off the new record  she wants to be onstage with me and she wants to sell merchandise   life through the lens of a tour baby  at home  we play the family band  my daughter is learning the tin whistle  my son is too young  so he dances  are there other traditions you   re anxious to explore  passion projects  i   ve got many  i   m really into the music of the early     s from what i call    black broadway     it was done for eight to    years by a cadre of black artists in new york who were putting on these shows  there   s a guy who went to oberlin   will marion cook  a composer and violinist and producer   he   s fascinating  a lot of people think    shuffle along    was the first black project on broadway  sissle and blake were considered the pioneers  but will marion cook was considered a mentor to them   write to missy
