       one of two sons of the founder who now run jbs chicken   s rise already is changing time honored habits  in argentina  where grass fed beef has long been central to daily life  per capita poultry consumption is projected to climb      this year to a record level  while beef consumption is expected to decline       even in pork loving china  the government has subsidized large scale poultry farms and breeding operations over the past decade to increase output as this year   s bird flu epidemic in the u s  shows  chicken also carries risks  poultry are vulnerable to diseases spread by wild fowl  and the vast numbers and close quarters of domestic flocks mean that contagions can spread rapidly  fear of disease and contaminated production have slowed anticipated growth in china   s poultry sector  damping business there for tyson and cargill breeding experts see solutions to many of the concerns in chickens    dna  because of the birds    rapid reproduction and quick maturation cycle  geneticists can effect changes in chickens relatively quickly  already scientists have increased the meat on each bird  today  a     pound chicken can be produced in    days using about   pounds of feed  according to data from virginia tech  thirty years ago  it took a little over   pounds of feed to rear a   pound bird in the same time  in some cases  breeders have had to solve problems of their own making  like leg problems and heart failure that have arisen as breeding efforts evolved the relatively wiry birds toward broad breasted specimens scientists completed sequencing of the chicken genome in        before any other major livestock animal  geneticists are now incorporating gene scanning technology to better understand how different sequences of poultry dna interact with one another  and how to emphasize traits that help birds resist disease  which the breeders believe could reduce the poultry industry   s reliance on antibiotics to keep animals healthy    we are only at the beginning of understanding everything we can do     says olivier rochard  the global head of the poultry genetics business at groupe grimaud  one of the world   s largest
