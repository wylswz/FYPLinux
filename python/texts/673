articles trump and clinton may face satan this fall if only he completes his paperwork           washington   the wheels of bureaucracy can   t stop turning here  so the federal election commission last month wrote a letter to god asking for bona fides not that one the one who goes by the same name  calls staten island home and filed in march to run for president of the united states because the fec   s charter requires it to treat all candidates seriously  its bureaucrats politely questioned god   s identity and asked why the candidate hadn   t included an accurate principal campaign committee and custodian of records    the fec has no opinion on the existence of god      ellen weintraub  one of the agency   s six commissioners  tweeted this month     but if she wants to run for u s  president  she has to fill out her forms like anyone else    satan  of college station  texas  got a similar letter     dear candidate  it has come to the attention of the federal election commission     the agency wrote to the campaign of satan lord of the underworld prince of darkness for a brighter future     that you may have failed to include an accurate candidate name and an accurate principal campaign committee    fec officials are writing letters this year to many of the nearly       hopefuls who have registered with the agency to launch      presidential campaigns  that   s up from     in the      election and includes candidates  darth vader  luke skywalker  captain crunch  the ghost of christmas present   mickey mouse and  francis underwood many more are filing this time because  since february       the fec has given candidates the option to take the first step toward the white house on an online form rather than paper    it   s easier to file for the fec than it is to create a gmail account     said ajay madala  a san jose  calif   eighth grader who in august filed to make a      penny a presidential candidate under the name one cent piece if human  the penny would meet constitutional requirements that a candidate be a natural born citizen and aged at least       any time somebody files a registration  it starts all sorts of wheels rolling    at the fec  said ms  weintraub  the commissioner  its analysts must review all reports for accuracy    it   s not the crime of the century     she said  still     you are taking up the time of government employees who have to unclog the system    the fec   s mandate is to make sure candidates are who they say they are and file proper documentation throughout the campaign  it isn   t for the fec to judge whether cranky pants is a legitimate contender in an aug     letter to cranky for president      in litchfield park  ariz   the fec delivered the message god and satan got  suggesting the campaign  listing cranky pants as candidate     may have failed to include an accurate candidate name    emailed for comment at the address in the filing  mr  pants was buttoned up even if cranky pants makes the fec cut  he isn   t likely to get a box alongside  donald trump   s and  hillary clinton   s names  candidates must petition the    states and the district of columbia to get on their ballots the fec can    administratively terminate    candidates  but that typically takes years  its hopes of getting suspected phonies to withdraw by november lie mainly in threatening legal action   rocky balboa got an fec letter last month noting that    knowingly and willfully making any materially false  fictitious  or fraudulent statement or representation to a federal government agency   is punishable under the provisions of    u s c                i figured  oh my goodness  they   re taking me seriously     said j  purkaple  an aspiring actor living in gladstone  mo   who filed for a campaign dubbed    rocky balboa running  to the sound of his theme song  for pres             i guess i am in trouble now     he said    nobody is going to go to jail over this     said ms  weintraub  the commissioner     but it is not a cost free operation     americans have made fictitious sounding fec filings since the      presidential election  just after the agency   s creation  when a  george washington filed  the      election included  santa claus and president emperor caesar  election        s candidate proliferation traces partly to  stephen colbert  said campaign finance lawyer brett kappel  the comedian in      created a super pac poking fun at special interests    influence millions saw how easy it was to form fec approved campaign entities  and americans launched more than     pacs with names such as joe six pac and bringin    sexy pac then the fec opened its online filing site  aiming to make filing easier and reduce paperwork at the agency the electronic paperwork flood that followed led it last month to direct staff to contact candidates whose filings included    fictional characters  obscene language  sexual references  celebrities  where there is no indication that the named celebrity submitted the filing   animals or similarly implausible entries     letters such as the ones to god and satan went out the letters may have prompted some to vanish  such as  ronald reagan   s ghost  of rochester  minn   who last week filed a termination report  fec records show jacob simmons  a recent college graduate  registered under the no bull committee  designating his college roommate as treasurer   while drunk  he said  he said he has received increasingly stern fec reminders to file fundraising reports mr  simmons  of north falmouth  mass   said he wants to drop out but hasn   t figured out how to  the fec website gives instructions for withdrawing but no obvious hyperlink to the termination form  and some candidates report finding the process confusing to celebrate his   th birthday  stentor danielson filed as happy laughterson   s merry band of unicorns  the fec wrote that his presidential committee  in pittsburgh  needed a candidate   s name the environmental science professor renamed his campaign happy laughterson   s merry band of unicorns for stentor danielson  that apparently satisfied election officials  who didn   t request more on his initial filing  instead  they bombarded him with notices about his financial reports  he said  and he is trying to figure out how to withdraw writing to god   s staten island campaign  an fec analyst said     form   must include the name  address  and type of committee  and  if the committee is authorized by a candidate  the name  office sought  including state and congressional district  when applicable  and party affiliation     giving    days to reply god didn t respond to requests for comment emailed to the candidate   s listed address  nor did satan  write
