articles how to get more out of office conversations           conversations in the office can be a delicate dance unlike many of the other routine talks we have in our daily lives  workplace chats come freighted with a lot of baggage we need to keep constantly in mind   for instance  whether they conform to stated corporate polices or unwritten etiquette rules  whether they might help or hurt our careers  or whether they could affect our relationships with colleagues the problem is that the differences between a bad conversation  a decent conversation  and a conversation where you accomplish your goals are subtle  being aware of those nuances offers people a chance to turn a blah conversation into a successful one with that in mind  i   m going to go through a typical workplace conversation  highlighting the subtle changes that can transform our interactions with co workers  i   ll be drawing on the most recent psychological research about what brings out the best and worst within and between people while they chat  studies that show that little things   subtle choices of words and tone   can make the biggest differences let   s start with a typical exchange  between a manager and a new employee  tom  i enjoyed the seminar you led yesterday  you were really organized and confident  especially for somebody who is new in the department   kayla  thanks  i   m leading another one tomorrow in front of the board at noon  i   m super nervous but trying stay calm   tom  i can   t make it  i   m scheduled for a conference call then  so annoying  but good luck   kayla  thanks  i   ll need it  on its face  this conversation is unremarkable  the tone is professional and respectful  kayla and tom exchange some information and move along but with a few simple tweaks  this conversation   any conversation   can become much more effective we   ve learned that tom enjoyed kayla   s meeting and is annoyed that someone scheduled a conflicting phone call for him  kayla is nervous for her presentation tomorrow  and is trying to stay calm  we know because they both labeled their emotions  saying things like    i   m disappointed because       and    i   m anxious about       is one of the clearest  most fundamental ways we can express ourselves unfortunately  most people don   t label their feelings well  people tend to say whatever feeling comes to mind  without considering what their label might convey or how it will make others feel  for example  saying    i am nervous    before a presentation might make someone think you are unprepared and lack confidence  and it might make them feel anxious as well or we tend to say that we   re feeling one emotion     i   m great      when often we experience mixed or ambiguous emotions  or oscillate between many different ones  by being nonspecific  we send the wrong signals about our feelings and aren   t as persuasive as we could be a related point to bear in mind  saying you   re sorry  research suggests that apologizing  even when you   re not at fault  as tom was not in terms of missing the board meeting   represents an expression of empathy and increases trust   without decreasing perceptions of power or competence we should apply emotional labels thoughtfully and purposefully  and we should apologize more liberally  let   s rewrite kayla and tom   s emotional labels  and have tom apologize for his missing the meeting  tom  i need to tell you  your work at the seminar inspired me  you were really organized and confident  especially for somebody who is new in the department   kayla  thank you  that   s very kind of you and makes me hopeful i can do well again  in fact  i   m leading another seminar tomorrow in front of the board at noon  i   m excited to get another chance to lead the group  they   re terrific   tom  i   m sad i can   t make it  i   m so sorry i   m scheduled for a conference call then  but i know you   ll inspire me again  good luck   kayla  thanks  i   ll need it  i   m grateful for your support  these new labels are more precise and vivid  rather than    enjoying    her seminar  tom was    inspired    by kayla   a positive emotion  focused on others  that simultaneously conveys warmth and high status kayla is    hopeful    and    excited    for her meeting tomorrow  not    anxious    or    trying to stay calm     reframing performance anxiety as excitement will make kayla focus on the opportunities associated with the board meeting  rather than the threats instead of being    annoyed      forcing blame on an unnamed victim   tom   s revised response is that he is    sad     reframing oppositional anger as shared sadness increases perceptions of empathy and social closeness  and he avoids foisting blame on an unsuspecting executive assistant finally  instead of just saying    thank you     kayla goes a step further  she is    grateful    for tom   s support  the phrase    thank you    has become so overused   so expected   that we often say it without really feeling grateful  or if we do feel grateful  we don   t say    i   m grateful    with precision tom and kayla didn   t ask any questions during their conversation  that isn   t surprising  many people don   t think to ask questions or don   t focus on the number of questions asked during a conversation  but they should  when we ask questions  people answer  by listening to the answers  we learn important information  and the person who answers feels    heard    and likes the asker for being empathic and attentive the type of questions we ask matters dramatically less than most people think  in fact  asking almost any question would be better than asking none or very few  of course  people shouldn   t ask questions without volunteering information  or else they will seem interrogative or even defensive so let   s put some questions in there  tom  i need to tell you  your work at the seminar inspired me   kayla  thank you  were there things i could have done better    tom  you were really organized and confident  especially for somebody who is new in the department  but i noticed you were leaning on your slides heavily  you shouldn   t be afraid to go off script   kayla  oh  that   s so helpful  and it makes me hopeful i can do well again  in fact  i   m leading another seminar tomorrow in front of the board at noon   and i   ll try not to keep referring to my slides  i   m excited to get another chance to lead the group  they   re terrific   tom  i   m sad i can   t make it  i   m so sorry i   m scheduled for a conference call then  are you covering the same kind of ground as yesterday    kayla  actually  no  i   m sharing updates about our new uganda initiative   tom  i didn   t know you were leading that project  that   s terrific  good luck   kayla  thanks  tom  i   ll need it  i   m grateful for your support   by adding questions  and appropriate answers   tom and kayla have exchanged a lot more information  kayla knows to lean less heavily on her slides  tom knows kayla is leading the uganda initiative   points that could prove to be quite helpful in the future  in addition  it is likely that they feel closer and like each other a little bit more compliments are endearing  even obviously insincere flattery makes people feel good  but we often undermine the effectiveness of our compliments by making them backhanded let   s consider this one     you did so much better than i expected     the compliment is completely nullified because the speaker   s expectations were obviously low  anytime we give a compliment  we   re usually thinking of a comparison set     you are competent compared with the other managers at your level     but we shouldn   t spell that out  or it undermines the effectiveness of the compliment  we can improve tom   s compliment by taking out    especially for someone new in the department     tom  i need to tell you  your work at the seminar inspired me   kayla  thank you  were there things i could have done better   tom  you were really organized and confident  but i noticed you were leaning on your slides heavily  you shouldn   t be afraid to go off script   kayla  oh  that   s so helpful  and it makes me hopeful i can do well again  in fact  i   m leading another seminar tomorrow in front of the board at noon   and i   ll try not to keep referring to my slides  i   m excited to get another chance to lead the group  they   re terrific   tom  i   m sad i can   t make it  i   m so sorry i   m scheduled for a conference call then  are you covering the same kind of ground as yesterday   kayla  actually  no  i   m sharing updates about our new uganda initiative   tom  i didn   t know you were leading that project  that   s terrific  good luck   kayla  thanks  tom  i   ll need it  i   m grateful for your support  taking out that one simple clause doesn   t seem to change much  but in fact it alters the whole tone of the conversation  tom is no longer condescending to kayla and making her wonder whether she really did well at the meeting   or just well for someone in her job humor is risky  successful humor can increase perceptions of status  competence and confidence  and makes the workplace more fun and pleasant  but unsuccessful humor disproportionately harms perceptions of status  competence and confidence jokes must strike a very tricky balance  they need to be benign  not too offensive  but also a surprising violation of norms or expectations to make people laugh  another way to say this is that successful jokes are funny and appropriate  this is especially true in the workplace  where norms and rules of appropriateness matter let   s make tom and kayla a bit funnier  a bit more charismatic  tom  i need to tell you  your work at the seminar inspired me   kayla  thank you  were there things i could have done better   tom  you were really organized and confident  the beyonc   of the boardroom  but i noticed you were leaning on your slides heavily  you shouldn   t be afraid to go off script  even beyonc   needs to improvise once in a while    kayla  oh  that   s so helpful  and it makes me hopeful i can do well again  in fact  i   m leading another seminar tomorrow in front of the board at noon   and i   ll try not to keep referring to my slides  i   m excited to get another chance to lead the group  they   re terrific   tom  i   m sad i can   t make it  i   m so sorry i   m scheduled for a conference call then  obviously  i am very busy and important  are you covering the same kind of ground as yesterday   kayla  actually  no  i   m sharing updates about our new uganda initiative   tom  i didn   t know you were leading that project  that   s terrific  good luck   kayla  thanks  tom  we   ll miss you tomorrow  but i   ll try to make you and beyonc   proud    their quips aren   t knock you out of your chair hilarious  but they bring levity and pleasantness to the conversation where boredom and boilerplate were before  tom also does a bit of self deprecating to make kayla feel even more at ease  it   s important to remember that almost nobody is a natural expert at recognizing and employing these nuances  even the smartest  most well intentioned among us make conversational mistakes  we say things we shouldn   t and don   t say things we should but it   s also possible for anybody to do much better  bearing in mind a few simple rules   label feelings with purpose  apologize  ask questions  give pure compliments  make jokes   will make our workplace conversations considerably more productive and memorable  dr  brooks is an assistant professor at harvard business school   s negotiation  organizations and markets unit  she
