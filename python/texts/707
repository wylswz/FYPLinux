 have all recently leapt into wireless  they   re playing catch up with sonos  the company that popularized whole home wireless audio i borrowed speakers from all of the above brands      in total   and set up a sonic showdown in the journal   s gadget vault  then i took my three favorite home and lived with them i learned that many speakers excel with a particular sound or unique aesthetic  i tested eggs  wedges and what looks like an alien head   but they can be sunk by fatal flaws  some audio companies are bad at building apps  while some tech companies aren   t great at shaping sound  and unlike bluetooth speakers  many wi fi speakers can   t just play anything that is on your phone   they require specific apps  if they don   t support a streaming service you use  they   re dead on arrival for most of us  sonos remains the wireless speaker to beat  thanks to crisp sound  even better software and a price that starts at       but it now has two serious rivals   bose   s soundtouch       and up  and denon   s heos       and up   here   s why they rock the key to sonos    success is its software  sonos apps for iphone  android  pc and mac are reliable  and make it easy to get to your music  even if you   re sharing with a family  with a few taps  you   re beaming different songs to different rooms  or bopping around the house to the same track on    party mode    sonos has a magical search that can hunt down the most obscure rolling stones b side on streaming libraries and your own collection all at once but sonos doesn   t have a monopoly on ease  bose and denon make simple  if less capable  apps that stand out in other ways denon   s speakers offer perhaps the most foolproof setup process  you connect an included cable between your phone and each speaker to get it running on your home network  then you unplug and you   re good to go  bose smartly realized that physical buttons still matter  you can assign presets   radio stations  playlists  you name it   to six buttons on top of its soundtouch speakers  with a tap  they start playing when you can   t be bothered messing with an app  which is more often than you   d think   raumfeld   s h  has four preset buttons  many of the speakers i tested owe a debt of gratitude to spotify  whose connect feature syncs and controls lots of third party devices from inside its own app  which is far better designed than most speaker apps   this means you can hop from listening to a tune on your run to hearing it all over your house  two of my top picks  bose and denon  use spotify connect the notable exception is sonos  which keeps most of its supported services  including spotify  inside a walled garden  closely controlled by its app  while simple  it can   t keep up with the way services are evolving new capabilities  sonos says it plans to open up in the future samsung and raumfeld   s apps are passable  but a little too confusing and slow  everybody else   s apps had serious usability problems old hi fi systems could play pretty much any device you plugged into it  such as a cd player or a turntable  most wireless speakers can play ordinary mp s stored on your phone  a computer or a home media server  but wireless systems can be finicky about streaming services  sonos supports the widest variety  some    services  including all of the most important ones like spotify  pandora   google

 play  amazon and tunein  i was surprised by how few other speakers carried these essentials  high end audio equipment maker raumfeld  whose promising new line of wireless speakers comes to the u s  in september  shockingly lacks pandora  they say they   re working on it  given how fast music is changing  you also have to trust that the system you invest in today will be compatible with your music five years from now  all of these speakers should gain new services over time  sonos won respect last month by announcing it will be compatible with the new apple music service some time later this year  others remain more of a question mark  to play apple music today  you need a wireless speaker that supports the iphone   s airplay  bose  wren  naim and phorus   or  you could choose one that has bluetooth  lg  samsung  phorus  monster and naim   those are also useful if a visitor wants to share music from a phone that isn   t already connected to your system  some wi fi systems like monster also let you broadcast a bluetooth stream to speakers all over your house   i   m not reviewing basic bluetooth speakers here  they   re convenient to beam tunes from your phone  but they   re generally weaker and not part of a whole home speaker network  for regular listeners  most wi fi speakers bring the noise  even serious audio systems use wireless now  like the       devialet phantom   the one that looks like an alien head  it has the ability to play uncompressed high resolution audio  and i   ve never heard anything like it   until the company fulfills its promise of an improved setup and user experience however  it isn   t worth the investment  price wasn   t always an indicator of sound quality in my tests  a pair of the      sonos play   speakers  so       total  scored about as well as the      wood cabinet wren v us and the        mu so from naim in a head to head with a single sonos play    bose   s      soundtouch    had more bass  and the      denon heos   even more yet  but i actually preferred the crisp sound of the sonos   for richer stereo on a budget  i recommend pairing two sonos play   speakers  each of which costs       samsung   s      egg inspired r  sounded just ok  however  i liked its more conventional m   available for as little as        three speakers were disappointing  the tiny      phorus ps   the oddly treble heavy      monster soundstage s  and muddy      lg music flow h  a word on wireless  you   ll need a robust wi fi network to play music without hiccups  sonos and raumfeld can also stream on their own networks for added stability  that may be worthwhile if your house is particularly large or inhospitable to wireless signals  but this is becoming less of a concern as home routers improve with the latest wi fi tech  and both bose and denon worked fine in my house once you go wireless  your speaker collection has a funny way of growing into a sonic empire  i started in my office  and next thing i knew  i needed them in the bedroom  the bathroom and next to the tv the best wireless speaker systems are easy to scale up  some makers use a common technology that allows us to mix and match speakers from different companies  i like this idea   in theory  polk  wren  definitive and phorus all share in the dts playfi standard  but they all suffer from the same poorly designed app   dts says it is planning a significant overhaul of its app   earlier this year  google introduced its own tech called google cast  today it works on wireless speakers from lg  it will begin working on new denon heos products coming out in the fall the best systems i tested came from makers who produce a wide assortment  my picks  sonos  denon and bose  runners up  samsung and raumfeld  they all sell multiple speakers designed for different sized rooms  and even ones that can provide surround sound for home theaters and just because the stereo of the future doesn   t require components  older wired speakers that still sound good need not end up in the garbage  sonos sells a      wireless stereo amplifier that can put any speaker on the internet   write to geoffrey a  fowler at geoffrey fowler wsj comor on twitter  geoffreyfowler
