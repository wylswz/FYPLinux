inhibition torture you want people to disagree with you more than the ministry of     how much been issues and what can     the education system due to how     it is     interesting insight that comes out of computer science which is that     you can bifurcate the field and data structures     and algorithms that some of the core of     thinking about competition     i use that as an analogy for education     the educational systems in asia and certainly in southeast asia india and china     are often emphasizing the data structures fact patterns of information     as to what to do with that information on a process that     i do interrogated that they can turn into     new and better forms of data so     in practice this to very tangible things i think we are lacking on symbian see s to think more broadly     one is a very tangible level of we don t have enough computer science graduates     with many people that are     lesser skilled computer technicians with people but complete intermediate roles     we need is more people with a four year computer science degree they can build     actual systems of whether it s in the tech world or elsewhere     the second thing goes back to the cause of the data structures algorithms     this a change in mindset that we need to have which is at an early age and much of asia mike and i can see this among friends and family in the region     children are often discouraged arguing that the timetable     grade educations begin in the home not just in the in in the school department     and creating a culture of debates of argument of confronting ideas     with structured fact based discourse in discussion     carries over beautifully into the workforce     we have a hard time hiring people that have the skills     in asia     it s either the or entrepreneurial but that incursion into being a younger age which stifled     it s hard to replicate that later in life     aside from ordering your employees of this busy looking good     aam     the entry and as barron s i think it s high i think there s some there is a lot of engineering talents     aam eating disorders in the u s banking in china it s actually okay     i d i d i agree that i ve seen     yellen startups there s no right answer     medial no wait imagine next we have the okay with that answer is making people in china not pots     to deal with     on the insurgency in in in in school there s always the right answer     in the life especially with certainty have to be yet to be on your own and have to be okay with that and failure and     and change so i don t think that one hundred generally     aam and and that s really hoping to change education and italy at the start with ken and i am grateful that the fall with tokyo is zero     we found in our businesses is an enormous arbitraged you can actually take tactical challenge from china     and bring them to india or     more realistically southeast asia     and use them to power companies it s a very successful technique     affiliate     summing the edges silicon valley over the years well at today s has been     very successful people talk about how important is to fail     i m     people has failed attempts as much but i think i m in really handy when i that s all singers about israel how failures so accepted and in silicom valley and     on this it s not like they re in china but i think     right now in the best read a bunch of liars for the next few years will be second time not ours     and a lot of them have failed     some of them have since risen and failed some then you know     where successful but i think those can be     the sides ours and that will win the failure and think     calls for a levy     on you know ten x     i think there needs be on the general acceptance of failure     aam     and the indies feel okay i which i was the premise of the question     i think     finalizing glorify feel the year     this is the deeper truth     which is we should be finalizing     controlled an     awful experimentation     was taking     which ebri blazing learning from experiments     and cycling that knowledge back into the system     in which guidelines me this is an oxymoron or kopitiam terms which got less and the humility that comes when people become humble because of failure which it looks to hobble from the very beginning     and
