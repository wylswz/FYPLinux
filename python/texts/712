articles an album at the corner of corny and sincere           in       a songwriter and conductor named  gordon jenkins all but singlehandedly invented the    concept album     at least that   s the term later applied to this particular means of musical expression  his pioneering work released that year was titled    manhattan tower     and it was a collection of original songs  linked together with narration and instrumental music  that told a coherent story in a manner that had obvious connections to musical theater but also used techniques from radio and film     manhattan tower    was slow to catch on  but within two years  by the time that long playing record technology had been introduced  it had become a huge hit   paving the way for    sgt  pepper   s lonely hearts club band    and    pet sounds    two decades later heard today     manhattan tower    is an amazing mixture  parts are hip and funny  like its best known number     new york   s my home     later performed by  ray charles  sammy davis jr  and  buster poindexter  among others   others are unbelievably hokey  like nearly all the narration   but  overall  this unique work still sounds innovative and fresh  in          manhattan tower    is celebrating both its   th and   th anniversaries  the original version was released in          years later  jenkins recorded an expanded edition  this time in hi fi and as a    inch lp  that included several new songs  most famously     married i can always get      both versions are available in the digital age  on cd and from the streaming services   jenkins   s third recording of the work  from       featuring  robert goulet  is also on apple music  pop diva  patti page made her own version in        at the time he recorded    manhattan tower    at the end of       jenkins             was in the middle of a successful career as a musical director  most notably on radio     manhattan tower    grew out of his fantasies as a young aspiring maestro growing up in missouri  dreaming of hitting the big time in the big town  he   d first come to new york at about age     as a novice arranger for a then famous dance band   isham jones and his orchestra   before his career took him to california  when he returned for several weeks in       he transformed both his boyhood dreams of the city and his first  golden memories of new york into this unique musical narrative culturally and structurally     manhattan tower    is a very forward looking work  its overall structure is unlike anything that had come before  and even the individual sections are rarely in the standard     bar aaba format of most popular songs  but what really makes    manhattan tower    something to ponder is that its content is just the opposite of cutting edge  it   s grandly sentimental to an almost absurd degree  at times hysterically corny   as when the narrator describes the key that opens the door to the tower as    aladdin   s lamp     but it   s an absolutely sincere and even passionate kind of corn in that sense     manhattan tower    has a lot in common with    oklahoma       although in reverse  the score to    oklahoma     represents what two street smart  broadway wisenheimers  rodgers and hammerstein  presumed was going on in the souls of pioneer folk  people who say things like    feller    and    winder      conversely     manhattan tower    is a love letter to manhattan of the kind that only a somewhat naive but hugely talented young midwesterner from webster grove  mo   could have conceived  a corn fed notion of east coast sophistication  perhaps that   s one of the things that makes    manhattan tower    so powerful  the hero is gazing up adoringly at his manhattan tower with farm boy mud  and worse  still all over his shoes by          manhattan tower    had grown so popular that jenkins was able to stage a live production of it at broadway   s capitol theater and four years later at the thunderbird in las vegas  in       he performed selections from the work on the  ed sullivan show  in       nbc tv produced an all star spectacular  starring  peter marshall and  helen o   connell  based on the new    complete    version of    manhattan tower     the live telecast was long thought to be lost  but the second half has recently surfaced in the library of congress   ethel waters steals the show  singing jenkins   s gospel style setting of  emma lazurus   s    the new colossus    even after    years of concept albums     manhattan tower    remains sui generis  jenkins continued to create original song story suites like    the letter     for  judy garland      the future     for  frank sinatra   and    seven dreams     one song of which inspired  johnny cash   s    folsom prison blues      but none of those later works had even a fraction of the original magic  there   s simply nothing like    manhattan tower    anywhere else in music   mr  friedwald writes about music and popular culture for the journal
