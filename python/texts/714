articles sb                                         the young nonprofit charged with building a performing arts center at the world trade center faces an uphill battle after a rocky financial start  the organization must now raise hundreds of millions of dollars  competing with the      memorial   museum for government funding and high profile arts projects for private donations  to succeed  it will need to assemble a high octane board  win over a thusfar noncommittal mayor and explain why the project is vital to new york at a time when a handful of similar theater spaces have opened in recent years  cultural leaders and arts management experts said the construction cost last march was pegged at      million   a price tag organizers have said they are trying to lower  some      million in federal funds have been allocated for the project   the jury is still out on whether this can be done   said karen brooks hopkins  president of the brooklyn academy of music  which opened a flexible      seat theater in        there may be a saturation point   i m not sure what it is  maggie boepple  the center s director  declined interview requests  a spokesman didn t respond to questions submitted by the wall street journal  except to say that until mayor bill de blasio appoints a cultural affairs commissioner   no arts organization knows what he s thinking   board chairman  john zuccotti also declined to comment in february  project organizers announced a revised vision for the center that includes three small theaters ranging from     to     seats  and producing a range of theater  music and dance  it tapped david lan  artistic director of the young vic theater in london  as a consulting artistic director in a previous plan developed by the bloomberg administration  the performing arts center had intended to create a       seat space for theater and dance in a building designed by frank gehry  who was selected as the project s architect in       mr  gehry s involvement in the project is now unclear  as is the role of the joyce theater  a dance company that was to have been a presenter at the center mr  gehry said he had had  a great working relationship  with former mayor michael bloomberg and his administration   we are looking forward to creating a new relationship with mayor de blasio and his team  about whom we have heard great things   he said for more than a decade  planners have envisioned a cultural centerpiece for the resurrected world trade center site  city hall incubated the project  working with mr  gehry to develop a conceptual design  mr  bloomberg s cultural affairs commissioner   kate levin  argued that a       seat theater would fill a void in new york  offering a venue for groups that couldn t take on the financial risk of trying to fill larger spaces such as the david h  koch theater at lincoln center  where the new york city ballet and american ballet theatre perform in december       mr  bloomberg appointed a skeletal board for a new nonprofit to build and run the center  it included mr  zuccotti  co chairman of brookfield office properties  world trade center developer larry silverstein  and mr  bloomberg s closest adviser  former first deputy mayor  patricia harris mr  bloomberg remained personally involved  most recently meeting with mr  gehry last may  according to a person with knowledge of the meeting  however  mr  bloomberg didn t allocate city capital funds to the arts center as he did for the culture shed  a planned far west side exhibition space also incubated by his administration  mr  bloomberg  ms  harris and ms  levin declined to comment on the current plans for the arts center the      memorial is seeking government funds to help cover its operating costs  and mr  zuccotti has said that additional public funding will be necessary to bring the performing arts center to fruition  arts leaders said mr  de blasio s support will be crucial   we are still considering how this should fit into the broader redevelopment strategy for the world trade center site   a spokeswoman for mr  de blasio said   are they too late   asked stanley katz  director of princeton university s center for arts and cultural policy studies   bloomberg had both the interest and the means to make this thing happen  the nonprofit had a rough year in       the lower manhattan development corp  delayed the release of    million in seed money  citing concerns about the project s price tag and the group s ability to raise funds  the arts center group ran a deficit that year of         out of a budget of           according to a federal tax return and audited financial statement recently released by the state attorney general s office  the group also owed nearly          to the      memorial foundation  which had served as an umbrella  in a fundraising plan prepared last spring at the request of gov   andrew cuomo s office  mr  zuccotti and ms  harris said they aimed to raise      million by the planned start of construction in       mr  cuomo has not yet announced a representative to the group s board  a spokesman for the governor didn t respond to requests for comment the project s cost is made greater by the complexity of the site  it would have to be constructed like a   d puzzle around infrastructure including path train tracks  a vehicle ramp  emergency subway exits and ventilation ducts that would come up through the arts center to more than    feet above street level  according to a person familiar with the city s studies of the site  the arts center would require extensive soundproofing to mitigate the subway vibrations once open  it would compete with similarly sized theater spaces built recently by the brooklyn academy of music  lincoln center theater  baryshnikov arts center and signature theatre company   all with an emphasis on showcasing new work  by contrast  the pershing square signature center  a gehry designed building on west   nd street with three small theaters  cost     million to build  arts leaders and observers had mixed reactions to the new arts center plan  it just seems to me like it s a hail mary   said duncan webb  an arts management consultant who teaches at new york university  others said that if organizers get past the fundraising hurdle  the idea could work  andr   bishop  artistic director of lincoln center theater  said he met with mr  lan in february to discuss the project   at the moment it is all fledgling and much to be worked out   mr  bishop said   but  mr  lan  is an impressive and smart guy  mr  bishop and other observers said the group hasn t yet made a clear case for its vision  but they noted that the emotional resonance of the world trade center site could be a strong pull for some donors  mr  lan has drawn parallels between the arts center and the young vic  which stands on a world war ii bombing site   where there was violence and destruction  art is now made   he said  according to a news release last month   it s as if theater has helped to heal the wound   write to  jennifer maloney at jennifer maloney wsj com
