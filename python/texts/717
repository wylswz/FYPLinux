 plc  the british utility  have tweeted about their early sampling of virtual reality meeting software  mike harlick  head of the bank of ireland worklab  said to him it felt like    the future of collaboration    mr  harlick told the wall street journal that his firm has been experimenting with several virtual conferencing centers  he said he doesn   t see virtual reality replacing video calls  but that it provides functions that other office collaboration tools do not offer  he said he thinks it will help his team be more effective in how they communicate    in the context of office meetings you now have a whole virtual environment where you can co create and interact     he wrote in an email     so you may have white boards on one wall  a shared document on another    the national grid employee who tweeted  david goldsby  said a team he presented to was    seriously impressed    by the technology  however  he said the wi fi in their hotel presented challenges  the company didn t respond to a request for comment still  for many companies  experts say virtual reality meetings may offer real improvements over the typical videoconference experience some of the earliest adopters are in videogaming and the virtual reality industry itself   neil glenister  founder of a london based gaming company called     studios  says his team has typically conducted lengthy weekly group meetings on skype  but the team  he says  is tired of videoconferencing  it doesn   t make them feel as if they are in the same room  he says  and they have trouble seeing each other   s hand gestures instead  mr  glenister and his team recently tried an app called vtime  which allows people to meet in virtual environments using avatars  from a menu of possible settings  mr  glenister and his employees chose to meet in a simulation of outer space at times  he says  they struggled to focus on work related topics because they were distracted by the planets surrounding them still  he says     that sense of presence was really good  the dynamics of the calls through skype weren   t as friendly    skype  which is owned by  microsoft corp
