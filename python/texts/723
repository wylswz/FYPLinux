consciousness     to sexuality     to homophobia rescue     economic oppression     photo studio to one and the next     one that     that that     those issues     that you     growing up     in jamaica     while     well it definitely in the economic disadvantage of seen it firsthand liaise with a grain of working class     and you know i they can be i was aam grey cup working class but then

they re at it and with nowhere to be confronted about it said it would top level with open one to call the tune of three here     in awe and so     those are the things them up the war we are off going back home     aam and another thing to that a stand in the book was aam and the accelerated towards in industry     as a said friday in no way back home again     and see the performance you know the hope people up not called to     the farm is a fantasy     that we have the tories but in the global and it s a completely different thing     and these other people what wanted to write a bolt was the highest allowing individuals to see     up close and personnel     the book is set     in eighteen eighty four right yet i wonder have things gotten better     in jamaica since then take the lead in regards to homophobia     you need is just as bad now     as it was stayed     in that time of this book     yes i e the people of satan olive garden that the fed lowered its they d

back on     in our class division that i m in sunny sunday that has been been there but also in awe when ab exists the world in which the existing     fit in your book     being an adult     but     what does that reality has its uses it you can be punished for that the health of the two women conductors of underground leadership in the book     another woman     aam it s a fixed income having a

weddings     on the island to write come into the decision to do that     what that was like in what was i invited out     well you know is this     mean having no waiting in     front of the system was actually born here after the main on     cnn or having time     for brunch or was it did and she mentioned to me only nine so it s possible if you book a private villa     and us on your wife can actually have a nice reception there were another wedding itself as though the legal stuff had happened here     with us or reception     as i thought was a great idea because one thing that that has     happened to me     often even when she was in the     housing morning because at that time not so much that is being away from jamaica from soared on     and so i said to myself     this is gonna be a part to my my journey into married or     anything all come in make stops at once offering with the end of my burn the two jamaicans have felt     that i was here in my wife s country she s american     and soul i wanted at the bit to be in jamaica make lunch as well     so knowing wunderkinder atmosphere jamaica is we opted for the private     waiting     at the products integration but not realizing that     i aam people work but if that were due in less than the spray old center that out heidi horrified when when the fun of my wife was deafening heart that you skip the meat and false claim back here     but in the lead in the fall well um i write to all the lovely thus breaking the story as it as it is all had as it was     on it and they met in in the middle of that to me

are not in our country     in on aam one hostel is very very adamant of all that     and so i do and what had to tell the story are we     doing the right back     with more from the cold dentist and the author of the new novel     here comes the sun     china says kevin since monday says     it is now on the on the podcast we talk about to come to an i phone the finer things in life this added wsj s     slash     and become a subscriber on i tunes     to be listed     it s within ambitiously     now back to this app is that john farley a senior editor at the wall street journal and here is that old dentist then is off to the new novel     here comes the sun     kinda priya but interesting about this book     it tackles the whole paradox of development     in one hand     you want to have these fees come and view ireland     and umbilical tells     an employee people     give people a way to feed their families     on the other hand sometimes comes with     a crushing costs were the big takeaway neighborhoods     and a push away     old ways of living and doing things     in your characters in this book     is that first and     tell him about why he thought the elsa interesting area to explore a     new book and     what you ve seen     of that grown up in jamaica     yes i m was upset not because it now     it is my last post of returning to the country itself and seen these new developments in that you are there other its wto at my mom s side     bits and pieces of that let were driving without thinking about returning here is a need to     concede that there were a beer can speed there is no there were going anywhere     and this is the perfect about getting people to be good jobs but     we re really     lucky few because of repeated     minimum wage or less in how safe is this treaty as the senate     seeking either     you know the harbaugh s warrants because     yet they have this this that this job is that there been glorified servants     and their job is solely to sell the country to score its best beerdom identical home to nothing at all make the chicken feed that they get     if the bag groceries maybe     at a uniform are too far and as an offspring but it is not to     invest in wales     are or the ship which i did not of the individual corby of the people to think in in her it s awful for him that he is doing     you know and one of the things that i ve stresses that     our country s beautiful greater than itself is beautiful but i think     the real beauty in the people     and is in our call chacon it s that funny to see that     will wait     to see people are looking at the time but dismissing the people     and in taking our call to an exporting it as well and they can bake bake bake um i mean given that there s nothing us to explore what are called to the export it     and you want to don t for the masses and some people take advantage of that attack on that     exploitation     in other prompts another angle to the     petition issues     in your book boost the women are often marginalized     economically     and socially     aam not getting the kind of job promotions they deserve     on the merits     aam and confinements and still really at odds with the worlds of ruled by a jamaican man     the money is the worst in jamaica that america is to make the kids had a female prime minister the female head of state     america hasn t gotten there yet and what he think the summit lift in both naked and america     is     that the gender wars are worse than to make a     midyear     well you know     in jamaica     eonmobil     the story i was there just     two weeks of the nominally was an snout to make an and that was featured in the jamaican the dow     and the word feminism came up     at a time i made a mistake of reading so in response to the money to me could be that as always responses     and some     of the had a problem with me seeing them in this table with the feminist and some all given negative connotation to that     so all you know what s been said before inherently unsafe cds graham in jamaica when men are the face of businesses he claims to us at a business and is a woman at the front desk     you ll be so will the fed as a woman taking it to the back is a woman giving you want to get the woman every we are     crazy out     of it is

forceful but is not seen     great faces some very interesting on economic as well aam     and so when even have enough email timing is of course there was a woman on the forefront     but she app dellacqua sold     so i m bummed on are also bought by and neo     energy in parliament making the effect on the pool was criticized     in all i think it was more than her beating so that shows the defence forces often criticized for being a woman     and efficacy of crp know i m mean if there s an app that i it s it s a meal coming eta the     aam rail     um so it so interesting that you said
