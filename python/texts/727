from the top and about     your bottom line     walking around     an election special from wall street     now the varsity     here is veronica dagher     to watching or else presidential election series on veronica dagher     jeffrey lupine is cheap retirement strategist     ed slott in co bought them to     thanks for having     jeff and my pleasure so they can its ideas were to be speaking out today are just ideas they may change in the league needs support from congress     is that kennedy became president we just     laid that out there     um so first let s talk about clinton she is proposing giving people credit for the time that they have served as     caregivers mc comes to sit at their social security benefit tells about a     chore so one of the ways in which you calculate your soul security benefit is the administration looks at your highest thirty five years  worth of earnings     and so if you don t have thirty five years of earnings     the end of factoring in the zero for those years and that s in this sense the penalty for those     who have stayed out of the workforce and care for trial the multiple children in fact many times when i look at someone salsa security statement     i can see say oh you had a child in this year and this year and because there is heroes surrounding those years     for the time that the person was of the workforce can for the child that we all know that is definitely a real work i absolutely i chilled or doritos and care for elderly parents to lie think she d be on the potentially talk about it syndicate at cloud     break on so let s talk about on her other ideas about social security she s not for a reason the full retirement age and she     she really has income and supportive at all she s     certainly the most progressive of the candidates between both are     and     as well is trumping johnson of course but she is     she wants to make sure that we not only keep so security where it is but also to kind of expanded and in many respects so     to to look at     giving additional benefits for those perhaps center in lower incomes     or just in general finding ways in which we can boost the system and get more benefits out to those in retirement has she said where that money would come from market she s given some ideas so one of the ideas she s talked about is raising the cap on soul security earnings     our earnings are taxable social security this year     you can make a hundred eighteen thousandfive hundred dollars and every dollar that     would be subject to fight the pencil security     but if you made one million dollars     only that first one hundred eighteen thousand five hundred would be subject to tax the rest of it would xk     and socialsecurity kind of loses income there and historically     about ninety percent of wages have been     subject to those soul security taxes     but because of the income     and quality gap has widened over the last few years and decades     we actually have now closer to about eighty to eighty three per cent     of earnings today subject to that packs a with much lower than historical levels interesting     ahead she said thing about privatizing social security     you know     she s really against privatizing she does these sees this as the government s role     in terms of making sure     that this is     not squandered in any way shape or form and i think she really just doesn t trust the private industry to handle that and there are some valid reasons and also some concerns with the way from now as well and d and it still looks at trapper love that what is the proposal and if so you know unfortunately we haven t had any real solid information from donald trump on his position please come and say it is there s been a promise made to the american people and he intends to keep that promise     so from this kind of a middle ground candidate in this where     clinton wants to expand     jerry johnson wants to shrink and compass that we ve made a promise we need to keep that to these kind of keep the train on the course and his     proposal for paying this so if you wanna call it a proposal is     that his ability to grow the economy crowed jobs create more we     wealth it s can it be subject to the soul security taxes     and that s how he s at least so far     talk about paying for these things interesting in a sense of when we might hear more details from the second half to come soon and more coming up the presidential debates relatively quickly i m sure that is going to be     questions on soul security it is a absolutely critical issue     i especially now as we get closer and closer and closer to the time when that trust fund     is going to run out of money in the promised benefits again be reduced to     seventy five to seventy eight cents a dollar their promise right now and and candidates don t wanna do that what are people saying that trust fund will run out what is the year second for different yet there are different says projection depends on who you do you listen to what you believe in     um but you know somewhere around twenty thirty three somewhere in that range and     it doesn t mean that no benefits will be paid it just means that the     ill be calm as it was initially intended to pay as you go system so all the money that comes in that year for most taxes     will go out and that will equate to again somewhere around seventy seven seventy eight cents with our promised benefits of the differing riskiest     of     ems and gary johnson just to talk about him quickly what is he saying that social security i he s looked at a number of ways in which we could     scale back salsa security for tickle e for those that     may not needed as much so perhaps the means testing     as well as raising the retirement age and he s the only one of the candidates that come out so far     and really     suggested that that may be something that we seriously need to look at and i think that s important because     if we look at things in a historical context people are leaving so much longer today so     many more people are living to the age that they are able to collect soul security     and then once they re they re they re living longer as they call salsa securities that s a huge drain on the system     relative to one s soul security was initially created     and dps ever really change how likely do you think that will     be in terms of people down to having a higher retirement age i don t know whether it happened this election cycle     aam but i think that is almost a foregone conclusion     you have to raise the full retirement age they can see a way in which the pop ups also scary unless we just     we ve increased the percentage of taxes that comes out we get rid of the captain     we view of lot of other things to bring a lot more money and the system     that age just has to rise people are just living too long today     and salsa security has become something that was never really intended to do     indeed     so tell us what steps are listeners can take a anderson all these are just ideas and proposals nothing is set in stone     but if you re listening to this that they say ok am hearing all these things from the candidates what ll i do with jackson s yet so i think the first thing is to understand what the candidates proposals are this really impact people directly so if you re going to go and cast a ballot this fall     you should make it as an educated voter and find out what the candidates positions on on bad nights and     you know with their positions as we think that s one thing testing of folk with your feet get up to go to the bow     and the other thing i think it s really important     for people to understand this as you mentioned several times either just proposal so not to pack pack is is not what you wanted to hear but     you may consider some scenario planning     you might say a what if soul security     is the only paying seventy five cents on the ballot come two thousand thirty three     how would that impact me     and depending upon     your listeners aged today i think it ll impact them differently for those that are close to     salsa security age already receiving soul security i think your tennessee     a minimal impact to their benefits over the long run for for a variety of reasons     i m not the least of which is that     that demographic tends to get to the polls yet so we know when you anything all     that     but to the younger     listeners you know a person to my own planning     on a factor in additional salsa secure in your malam via mobile family i think that s where all     the cia and nsa     but you know that something that i tube leisel secure he will be there for me in some way shape or form but it s a you know what if i plan without it whenever i get is gracie     and obviously those in between came to be somewhere within those bounds so i think that     not over reacting but just considering how changes would impact you when     considering working longer     you know every entry years in     the year of not only income that you re getting but it the labels youtube enables you to contribute to your retire account     and most importantly it stops you from draining your time the captain these so that unknown time horizon of retirement whatever it is just that shorter by one year and that s a huge thing so     things or people the one here a work longer make more money save more and more     really you know will benefit people if they are material changes that impact soul security and reduce     its     excellence and think you so much staff now thanks for having me stay     sane is that
