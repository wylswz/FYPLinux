articles saving tokyos hotel okura            completed in      and designed by yoshiro taniguchi  hideo kosaka  shiko munakata and kenkichi tomimoto  tokyo   s hotel okura has for decades been a beloved destination for design minded travelers  but this fall  an epic two phase redevelopment is slated to move forward in anticipation of the      summer olympics  tearing down first the striking main building followed by the less architecturally significant secondary wing  the new main building is slated to reopen in the spring of       tomas maier  bottega veneta   s creative director and a devotee of the okura for more than    years  talks about his campaign to save the renowned hotel   and other japanese architectural treasures that could be in danger    my first trip to japan was in       at the time  i was a fashion designer working for a french company and traveling from paris  i happened to stay at the hotel okura in tokyo  and i was mesmerized  i remember getting out of the cab  walking up to the hotel   s very low overhang  then seeing the breathtaking view into the central lobby and the paper screens and lanterns  everything was done beautifully  in concert with traditional japanese artisans   some crafts that don   t even exist anymore  the rooms were still not renovated   they were simple  clean and beautiful  with paper walls and sliding screens  the room renovation  which happened sometime around the late     s  didn   t come out well  they were too westernized  but the common areas were never noticeably touched   the bar  restaurant  lobby and elevator landing the interior decoration exudes a certain calm and comfort  above the japanese paper shoji screens in the lobby  the asanoha mon wooden screen highlights the intricacy of putting small triangles together to form a hexagon  a corner of the space showcases the constantly changing shadows of bamboo on the japanese paper shoji throughout the day  and on one side a decorative wall was commissioned to highlight the orchid as a motif  woven in handmade silk in the nishijin style  when you look down on the lobby from above  the arrangement of the lacquered table and chairs makes them appear as if they are plum blossoms in full bloom  the okura has an interesting mix of contrasts  colors and materials incorporated in a traditional yet modern design  i   ve stayed there on almost every trip i   ve taken to japan   nearly    or      over all those years  the current status of the hotel is that it is supposed to be closed in late august and then demolished  the reconstruction is related to the      summer olympics  to be held in tokyo  and they want to get the hotel in shape for that  yoshiro taniguchi was one of the architects of the original structure  and now his son  yoshio  is doing the new one  a father  son and two buildings   that   s an incredible story it   s an    story building  and now everything is high in tokyo  with the same square footage on the ground  the developer thinks they need to get more out of it  there   s the main wing and then the architecturally less interesting south wing  which was added later   the south wing has    floors  giving the okura     total rooms   to me  it would have been the perfect scenario to tear the south wing down and build a taller building there  keeping the original main wing  from the latest i heard  they may try to preserve the lobby  it   s supposed to be dismantled and reincorporated into the new design  though i don   t really know how that   s possible  i suppose that   s already good news  and maybe it   s worthwhile campaigning for that  but i look at it in a bigger picture  there is no landmarking for modern architecture in japan   no guarantee that all these beautiful buildings won   t be torn down at any time  that   s why we  at bottega veneta  have teamed up with casa brutus  a design and architecture magazine in japan  to raise awareness  toshiko mori  who teaches architecture at harvard  is also active in the campaign  as are the designer marc newson and the artist  hiroshi sugimoto  in an ideal world there could be a landmarking committee and a couple of great architects and historians who could get together and save each building   one by one   for future generations in japan  the instinct to preserve modern architecture is not part of the society  we don   t have the same problem with mid century buildings as much in the united states  in the states  it would be like tearing down really important landmarks  such as the  marcel breuer building that formerly housed the whitney  or  philip johnson   s glass house or  frank lloyd wright   s guggenheim  the list of buildings that are in danger in japan is endless  one is kenzo tange   s kagawa prefectural gymnasium  the structure itself  architecturally  is amazing   it looks like a huge floating ship i don   t even want to think about where i will stay if there   s no okura  i always want to have hope that the main building will be preserved   but maybe not  until the last minute  you never know      as told to ted loos
