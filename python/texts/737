articles finding the spell of the stage on the page with harry potter and the cursed child           what does it mean to call a book a    best seller     according to publisher   s weekly  you have to sell     copies a day to crack amazon   s top five fiction list  so consider this     harry potter and the cursed child    was published on july     by aug     it had sold two million copies so far  most of those two million readers appear to be perfectly happy with the new harry potter book  but the reviews posted on amazon suggest that a fair number of them are sorely disappointed  nearly a quarter of the reviewers gave the book a rock bottom one star rating  some were vexed because  j k  rowling didn   t write it  a fact that is noted on the cover  though you have to look twice to see it  in addition  though  many people seem to have been surprised to learn that    harry potter and the cursed child    is not a novel by ms  rowling but a play by  jack thorne   for the record  it opened in london two weeks ago to rave reviews  meaning what  well  here   s how    hpatcc    starts out     act one  scene one  king   s cross  a busy and crowded station  full of people trying to go somewhere  amongst the hustle and bustle  two large cages rattle on top of two laden trolleys  they   re being pushed by two boys  james potter and albus potter  their mother  ginny  follows after  a    year old man  harry  has his daughter  lily  on his shoulders     at that point  the characters start talking and the play gets under way compare this with the opening of    harry potter and the sorcerer   s stone     the first potter novel     mr  and mrs  dursley  of number four  privet drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  they were the last people you   d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn   t hold with such nonsense     this is followed by three full pages of richly detailed description  only then do the characters start talking therein lies the problem  unlike a novel  the script of a play is a set of instructions for creating a theatrical experience  not the experience itself  if you read a script after you   ve seen the play  you   ll remember what you saw  and the action will make sense to you  if not  you   ll have to    stage    the play for yourself in your mind   s eye  unless you   re a theatrical professional or a seasoned playgoer  you   re likely to find that difficult to do  this is why most plays are published not by trade houses but by specialist publishers like dramatists play service inc  and samuel french inc   which cater mainly to professionals not so long ago  though  it was common for the scripts of hit plays to also be published in trade editions  some of which are quite readable  what makes them so  up to a point  the older the play  the more readable it   s likely to be  the dialogue in a play like    hedda gabler    or    the importance of being earnest    may not sound    natural    to our ears  but it   s a lot easier to read than that of a modern playwright like  david mamet  whose ultra naturalistic scripts sometimes look as though they   re written in shorthand   here are the opening lines of mr  mamet   s    glengarry glen ross        john   john   john  okay  john  john      in addition  though  many of the most popular plays of the   th century were published in editions that were designed to be readable  take a look at  say   george s  kaufman and moss hart   s    you can   t take it with you     the published script contains detailed word portraits of both the set and the main characters     a girl of about     very slight  a curious air of the pixie about her     these stage directions are useful to actors and directors  but they also help bring the play to life in the theater of the mind   george bernard shaw was the first playwright to bring out his plays in versions intended for the lay reader  because he couldn   t get them produced  he paid to have them published  and sought to    transmogrify    them  his word  in such a way as to make the scripts    more thrilling than any novel     in addition to inserting long  nontechnical descriptive stage directions  he prefaced each play with an essay explaining what it was all about  not only did the published versions sell  but they created a demand for stage productions of the plays so whenever you   re tempted to try your hand at reading a play you   ve never seen  be it    glengarry glen ross    or    harry potter and the cursed child     follow this one simple rule  open to where it says act one  if the next thing on the page is an evocatively written paragraph that describes the play   s setting  keep going  otherwise  wait until you can see it onstage  you   ll be glad you did  mr  teachout  the journal   s drama critic  writes    sightings     a column about the arts  every other thursday  write to him at tteachout wsj com
