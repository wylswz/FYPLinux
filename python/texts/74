each year  africa is gathering in new york on the occasion of the africa week  each year  the nepad presents its various achievements for the past    months to its numerous partners from all over the world  it is then timely that this year africa week will celebrate new partnerships  one inevitably thinks of the new partners africa has found in what is called the south         even if most of these countries don   t own any square mile of land in the southern hemisphere to be fair  partnerships with countries outside the west have existed for a very long time  but it is a fact that in the modern period  let   s say the   th century  the colonial era has prevented any other nation   s influence or relationship to africa  we africans had to wait for the decolonization to observe a real change in our relationship to the world some countries were quick at this time to affirm their friendship  among them  china was one of the newer players  the newly found interest in africa translated in what has been called    stadium diplomacy     mainly designed at gaining diplomatic support for its recognition at the un  i don   t think it unfair to say it did not translate into a truly mutually beneficial relationship sadly  at the time  africa was little more than a strategic playground for foreign powers absorbed in the cold war  non aligned countries found it hard promoting a third way  this was then extremely good news for africa that this whole system finally fell apart in the early      s  but africa as a continent was not close to achieve its real independence this is because one needs to diversify their commercial partners and talk in one voice to gain true political independence  the creation of the african union in      allowed africa to talk in one voice and find a more solid place in the concert of nations  at the same period it embarked on a path to prosperity  even if tortuous at times  then chinese interest in africa translated in much more useful infrastructure thanks to a very palatable      billion bilateral trade per year new partners include india  with whom africa trades at an all time high of     billion  brazil  the gulf countries  turkey    in other words  we managed to build business and political relationships on an equal footing with countries from all over the world  older partners such as europe  the united states or japan have adjusted to this new context  foreign direct investment and corporate relationships today dwarf aid channels  i believe it is a good sign of africa   s credibility on the world stage these new partnerships have also had the expected and desirable side effect of allowing the savviest african countries to foster competition and extract better deals for its resources as well as choosing its partners in  say  the building of infrastructures  today  brazilian and french construction companies compete for mega projects  this can only benefit africa and its people what is next for africa in this multi polar world  first  we need to ensure we talk in one voice to other giant countries  don   t forget that india and china are each as populous as africa  brazil is     million strong  more than any african country on its own  hence the necessity for the continent to function more and more as one entity  at least at the economic level  for instance by offering outside powers access to a single market with unified norms  or by talking in one voice to its bigger partners one other huge topic that cannot be overlooked is how this situation will help to foster a true african entrepreneurial spirit  it is a good thing that foreign investment is pouring into africa and that the risk perception is improving  it would be better still if a wave of african champions could emerge from this economic trend and that these companies could benefit from the investment needs of the continent  for this the states must step in with better education  better rules for doing business  better infrastructure  this requires a change of mindset because for all the much hyped economic growth there has been in africa during the past    years  our continent is still home to     million people living below the poverty line  and its share in the global trade is no more than     globalization is not a choice  it is a force that we have to control in the best of our ability  the world is going through turbulent times and the next ten years are going to decide who benefits from the next ascending winds from the globalization  if africa is to be among the winners  it must learn from its partners and cultivate its own industrialization by taking advantage of its regional markets  nepad agency chief executive offic
