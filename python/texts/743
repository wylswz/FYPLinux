articles nice trash can lets see what the bears think           west yellowstone  mont    the first time the bears steal human food  they are relocated    miles away  the second time  it   s    miles  and the third time it   s      after that  they become consumer product consultants at the grizzly and wolf discovery center  just outside yellowstone national park  eight bears with a demonstrated aptitude for raiding trash cans  breaking into parked vehicles or burgling chicken coops have seen their skills put to use as product testers the idea is simple  if a manufacturer of outdoor gear wants to market its product as bear resistant  there is one way to know for sure  bear keepers fill the container with a treat such as peanut butter  fish or meat  set it out in the grizzly enclosure  then let the bears out of their gated dens and stand back if your product survives a    minute mauling  congratulations   you   re bear resistant  that stamp of approval is coveted by makers of products for campers and rafters  not to mention trash bins  but it   s no slam dunk  one grizzly  kobuk  is so skilled at defeating the lids and latches  or the sides  of food containers that he is nicknamed the destroyer   bill michael  owner of an arizona manufacturer called northland products inc   has subjected multiple versions of his automated garbage containers to the destroyer   s inspection over five years  tinkering with the design until it finally outwitted kobuk and his associates    if he finds something on that can and he perceives that he   s getting some mileage in chewing  pulling this area  or sees a weak spot  he will just focus on that and will even try that much harder     mr  michael said when grizzlies in the wild persist in going after people   s food stores  trash  bird feeders or dog food  wildlife officials capture them by luring them into a length of steel culvert outfitted with a trap door  then tag and relocate them  bears usually get three chances to stay out of trouble  one breeding female was given six  but kept returning to the golf course where some people had fed her pizza for a photo opportunity  while many repeat offenders  deemed a danger to humans  are subject to being euthanized or sent off to zoos  a select few go into consumer product testing  the program at the grizzly and wolf discovery center  which isn   t affiliated with yellowstone national park  is geared toward developing food containers so stout even a grizzly can   t open them to prove otherwise  the eight bears at the discovery center exhibit a smorgasbord of techniques  from clawing and biting to smashing products against rocks and rolling them downhill    bears are just very food driven and very smart     said  randy gravatt  who runs product testing at the center     if they get a big food reward  they remember    one time tested maneuver resembles frenetic cardiopulmonary resuscitation  with a trash can lying on its side  the bear stands on its hind legs  looms over the can and pumps furiously up and down trying to break it open     they   re trying to feel that flex  they   re trying to feel that weak point     mr  gravatt said  as a grizzly called roosevelt attacked an ice chest from academy sports   outdoors  of katy  texas  during a recent cooler challenge    i admire their persistence     said  diana coyle  a real estate agent visiting from nearby island park  idaho  if the latch mechanism stays intact  and if bite and claw damage to the container measures less than an inch and a half after an hour of the bears    best efforts  the product passes  the center treats    to    products a year to this abuse  for a      fee  and also raises money by selling tickets to visitors    we   re at a     pass rate for coolers  and this one looks to be holding up very well     mr  gravatt said as the five year old grizzly mauled the         ice chest  after an hour of his pounding  prodding and clawing  the cooler passed to keep the bears fresh and engaged  the center occasionally gives them a dummy product for an easy break in  such as a plastic trash can secured with zip ties    if we tested a product    times in a row and every time it was bear resistant  and every time the bear did not get in and get a food reward  they may not try on the   th one     mr  gravatt said passing the discovery center   s test is the gold standard for bear resistance certification from the interagency grizzly bear committee  a group of representatives from state and federal agencies that promotes grizzly populations in the u s  and canada    they hibernate for five months of the year  so they   re very food motivated  they   re constantly looking for and learning where to go for high quality foods     said  kerry gunther  head of bear management at yellowstone national park raiding garbage is an easy food fix for hungry bears  but safety concerns arise when the potentially aggressive animals become conditioned to people  safeguarding bears from human encroachment into their natural habitat is a constant challenge for conservation agencies  and keeping bears away from unnatural food sources is a key component doing its part  the interagency grizzly bear committee certifies not just ice chests and trash cans as bear resistant  but also an extra tough kevlar backpack and an electric fence meant to keep the bears away from chicken coops or campsites    we do make that note that  the certified products  are not bear proof     said  scott jackson of the u s  forest service  an adviser to the committee  the bears    are just amazingly strong  and there   s a lot of ingenuity there    in the end  he said     given enough time  it   s hard to make anything bear proof
