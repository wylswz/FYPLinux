articles what to do with leftover     money           saving for college is on readers    minds as graduation season progresses  we again asked college finance experts to answer readers    questions  most of them centering on popular tax advantaged savings accounts such as           plans and coverdells  there is money left over in the     i funded for my nephew  can i change the beneficiary to myself and use the money to study a foreign language at a university or language school  yes  you can change the beneficiary to yourself or to any close relative of the original beneficiary  and you can study languages at a school that   s eligible to receive     money  says  james canup  tax practice chairman at law firm  hirschler fleischer in richmond  va    many eligible colleges and universities offer language classes  some even offer academic majors in foreign languages   so look for opportunities at a local college or university     says  mark kantrowitz  publisher and vice president of strategy at college scholarship search site cappex com  if you   re at an eligible school  you can take as few classes at a time as you like   unless you want to use     money for housing  in which case you   ll have to attend at least half time and work toward a degree or certificate  he says   can a coverdell account be used to pay for off campus housing  yes  with restrictions  coverdell funds can be used to pay off campus housing expenses for a student who is enrolled in a degree or certificate program and who attends school at least half time at a qualified college or university  says mr  kantrowitz  you can use the funds only up to the college   s official allowance for room and board  a coverdell   unlike a       can also be used for off campus housing for elementary or secondary students  but only if the school requires or provides it  mr  kantrowitz says  i understand that if i pay a grandchild   s tuition directly to the institution  there is no tax consequence for me or my grandchild  does this apply only to tuition or does it include room and board  you are right  if you pay your grandchild   s tuition directly to the school  the money is exempt from both gift taxes and generation skipping taxes  but the tax code   s language is specific to tuition  so it doesn   t apply to room and board or to other qualified expenses such as books  says mr  canup  those expenses  paid on behalf of your grandchild  might still incur taxes if you had used up your         individual or         joint spousal gift tax reporting exemption for the year   of course  even if you have to report the gift  it doesn   t mean gift taxes are necessarily due  because of the much higher lifetime ceiling on gifts  and beware  tuition payments that people other than the student   s parents make are factored into fafsa financial aid eligibility and count as    cash support to the student    when colleges compute financial aid  mr  kantrowitz says   can     funds be used for any of the costs associated with searching for and applying to college  how about travel costs to visit prospective colleges  testing and application fees  no  the irs is clear on this  precollege costs don   t qualify for     funds  mr  kantrowitz says  salesmen often tell parents to sell taxable assets and buy annuities to better qualify for financial aid  is this worth doing  annuities usually aren   t a smart strategy for college savings  says mr  canup  if you sell assets to buy an annuity  you   ll pay taxes on any gains  while if you take money out of a     plan for qualified educational expenses  gains are tax free  he says with an annuity  you would typically borrow money from the policy if you wanted to pay for college  that amount is owed with interest and must be repaid  if instead you take a payout from your policy  you   ll have to pay taxes on the distribution above the premiums you paid  and you may also owe a surrender charge  in addition to a     penalty for withdrawing before age       and don   t forget  mr  canup says     the salesman will also earn a nice premium  which is reflected in the amount you pay for the annuity    this may all be for naught as far as aid is concerned     generally  families who have sufficient assets to lose eligibility for need based aid have sufficient income to lose aid eligibility even if they had no assets     mr  kantrowitz says  he suggests speaking with a fee only investment adviser who doesn   t sell annuities or life insurance about the pros and cons of such an investment before you buy it  an annuity salesman doesn   t have a fiduciary responsibility to you  mr  kantrowitz notes also  although annuities don   t figure into the fafsa     most private schools and private sources of financial aid do factor in annuities and other excluded assets when making financial aid calculations     mr  canup says  that means an annuity won   t make those assets disappear for aid purposes  ms  schoenberger is a writer in new york  she can be reached at reports wsj com   corrections   amplifications gifts including direct payments to a grandchild   s college or contributions to a student   s           college plan account are generally reported under gift tax rules when they exceed         during the year  or         for a couple   but the gift tax itself won   t necessarily have to be paid  because of the lifetime ceiling on gifts as well as  in the case of    s  a special rule that allows one year   s gift to be spread over five years for tax purposes  an earlier version of this article incorrectly implied that gift taxes would always kick in at those levels   june
