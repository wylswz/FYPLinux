countryside with this month   s opening of soho farmhouse   a     acre  private members    club and country house hotel in oxfordshire  located a    minute drive northwest of london  off the winding countryside roads of great tew  soho farmhouse is a fusion of private members    club  country club and hotel  although the grounds are typically just for members  who get special rates on accommodations   paying non members can stay in the guest cabins and are free to use the facilities of the club during their visit members or not  visitors to the sprawling estate can expect their vacation to start the moment they check in  upon arrival at the gatehouse on the grounds  guests are handed cocktails as their vehicles are whisked away to an on site car wash     i   m doing away with traditional check in     says jones  who explains how a hidden camera scans license plates as guests enter the property     when you drive in  we   ll already know who you are  we   ll take your luggage  and you won   t see your car again for the rest of your stay   the whole of soho farmhouse is car free     instead  visitors to the club can be transported to various areas of the expansive grounds on restored     s milk trucks or bespoke foffa bicycles provided to each of the    individual cabins  which range in size from studios to three bedrooms  as well as a seven bedroom farmhouse

wellington boots for their stay    we   re trying to create something that is as under designed  unpretentious and comfortable as possible     says alex jackson  the lead architectural designer for in house design  soho house group   s architectural firm     we   ve approached this like designing a village     the complex is a mix of restored   th century farmhouses and new buildings  but its heart is the farmyard  which consists of a former working farmhouse and courtyard surrounded by the main clubhouse barn  the reception area  a cooking school  a deli shop  a pub and a flower shop  plus  there   s a home and accessories store with products designed by the soho house team  which will launch later this year  available first to members only  as an online retail venture called soho home

area where children can play and parents can kick back and relax  locals have lauded the project for its sensitive architectural response to the pastoral surroundings and soho farmhouse   s efforts to integrate the community   s food producers and artisans into its daily operations  for example  produce and provenance are key to its ambitious culinary program  which will be led by the michelin starred london chef  tom aikens     we will make our own charcuterie and cured meats and smoke our own meat and fish     explains aikens  who has recruited an army of culinary experts to oversee the on site cultivation of over     different fruits and vegetables     eventually  i want everything on a plate here to be what we make or produce ourselves      although there are plenty of activities  from horseback riding to boating  jones has ensured that the wooden guest cabins are well equipped so that visitors can be as self sufficient as they want  all of the cabins have a waterfront view of one of the estate   s three man made lakes or stream  and all but the studios boast fully functioning kitchens with an oven  grill  toaster  le creuset cookware  coffee and ice machines  a full bar and a stocked pantry  added bonus  if guests don   t want to make their own cocktails  they can summon one of two    hour roving milk trucks that have been converted into portable bars with bartenders on hand  and two mobile    greasy spoons    are on call to serve epicurean guilty pleasures  how would jones  known as hospitality   s rebel against formality  sum up soho farmhouse     this will be a country club     he says     just without all the stuffiness and bullshit that usually goes with it
