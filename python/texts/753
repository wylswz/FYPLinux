say ahead of the headlines     say on top of the markets     this is     her down the street     from the wall street     hello and welcome to heard on the street the podcast we are the wall street journal s home for commentary on all things financial all over the world     reporting from new york and erie and capri joined by my colleague spencer jacob high spencer primary him     in our second segment we will discuss whether department stores such as macy s and kohl s conceive themselves from decline     but first we had heard on the streets returned farley on the line from london     to talk to us about a strange new breed of german bonds     i richard     primary in a day     good good to have you     had     initially seen hiking get this straight     traditionally zero coupon bonds don t come with any interest payments but they re traditionally sold at a discount to face value     so investors reap the rewards of the rising prices they get closer to maturity     but these new german     bonds the new german iteration of the zero coupon bonds     he s no interest     e and has no price appreciation over time     so why on earth would people buy these bonds     that s a very good question     and     the first reason is because the schools on offer     it rates every such a valuable in gemini     the german government is able to issue bones     at the cereal inside to negative yields safe     fisheries eric and bones people paying them more in the face value     the taurus gemini gets one hundred     point five years today and paced back a hundred years continues time     it sounds insane     which     makes reviewed makes perfect sense to some extent     but     there are some of this is for you     secure issue unique way to seek out more than raton     people like     forum for reserve manages from the central banks of the key criteria for them is secure she liquidity above one of us     the second seemed to say is that     deals on to new joan bones of still above     the ema the negative they re both well with the ecb peoples the rate is the catch     it s a relatively these a more attractive     march i didn t catch more traction in cash and a lot of people have to invest they didn t have to trade a huge cash     i m the final reason is that such top     fifteen in its palms has been a bad idea to to     the people that a new gym and bones     in generated see it     you d now be opened up belk cinema hoffa said     even though you ll swat extraordinary though the sauce this year     they ve just gone lower and lower     and and so that i does that third point that you made in it s     it s almost akin to a greater fool theory you know a few     today if you you purchase     of bonds and have a profit motive in mind     you are     betting on the eels going even more negative     and some greater fool buying it but someone at the end of the chain     inevitably is going to lose money isn t the right     absolutely     absolutely     the one force that you do have that is unusual this of course is the ecb     which is going on buns with the great lakes region been in years month     and because of the way it sets up its program     there s a petite kiama sweeties home loan base the gym and bones because     the ecb one by anything that yields less than its deposit rate     now     the short end of the german cut of     all full of paper is now trading     below two minus zero point four meals experts     say the ecb is squeezed up into a moment     and said there is actually of constant fire in the market for these kind of paper     but yet it still seems like this is kind of our race team that they hear that you re betting that somebody     will buy this at a higher price than what you re paying for it     absolutely     and     this is the into it it makes real sense on on on a kind of a medal went on to step back from     the forces that are acting on its toes of mine     and in addition the     this is before we even sauce to think about what inflation might do to these bones by the time     inflation in the moment is very very low     but these bones continues to run     the than     the best you can do at the moment is to use small amounts of money in normal times the real losses on these bones     could yet be counted on to     and so     here you have as you said that there are investors who don t have the luxury of     just sitting in cash of putting cash into a vault or     putting it into something that at least doesn t lose value     what sort of dilemma faces those investors i m thinking of your pension funds and insurers and the like     you     must     put into something and how often have to put it into the safe     negative yielding assets     it s the it s a very a question that it knew there is a potential for this is the perfect end to the point when negative rates     of the car     in this     they may cause     potential problems for pension funds insurance companies and so on     to all     who are a means to live a much higher returns than our other available in the sky blue yielding low     um     and they will say they contain champ of those effects and save this today and     decided he actually need to save more because of returns is loaded     i don t see we know to what it sting to a function this way and the concern is the bancroft is that she is being     the severely damaged     by strathfield goes and hopefully rights     and it was just one more tactical question of this is all belong here but i mean you have these     of the of east ecb     applying existing bonds and was the business he said their constrained in what they can buy     a bottle of existing bonds of our     very high premium to the par value     because they use to have a coupon rate     of once those are snapped up a new up only half were mostly have these sorts of bonds the     german treasuries not going to be paying any     and there were very much     how to determine the form of couponing come either i     exactly know this is good that this is been an absolute due to the gym and taxpayer groups to be interested in germany has full of remarkably     and also in     because the german government is running a balanced budget     there is no increase in supplies     the german government to a un usually months governments being confronted with free money     it is not actually running say yes we ll have more of it     that s very interesting thank you richard we are going to have to take a break     coming up ten retailers

the street the podcast i miriam gottfried here with spencer jacob and our colleague steve russolillo     steve thanks fatten him     good to have you steve after a few quarters of whom really bleak results we ve seen a surprisingly positive reaction to earnings reports for macy s and kohl s     and he s sending getting squeezed between amazon     and which is moving deeper into clothing     and discounters like t j maxx taking share why do you think things all assignment their way this quarter when it s a it s a really tough environment for from the season so their announcement thursday morning really was almost a sigh of relief from wall street so macy s so that they were going to close one hundred stores that s about fifteen percent of their their total stores which is a lot easier to get by they announced earlier this year that they re going to close forty stores so     in the span of a few months they realize though forty is not enough what s more than double that and now announce another hundred stores so that was really that big shocking revelation because the numbers     for macy s     don t their ok the baby on the on the top and bottom line in there but expectations have come down a time and iii and same store sales were down but they went down as much as as people anticipated so     the stock is up sixteen percent this morning it s accused one day rally here for for macy s bacon and if you zoom out and look to longer term picture the stock is really been hit so hard at this point so     to get back to earlier question am i think that this is really all that macy s can do great now and then facing so many conflicting forces amazon     them is on the red the threat of other discount retailers as you mentioned t j maxx     of really all this is hitting them hard and so     really all they can do is try to     trim down and focus more on e commerce     and steve you you you set in your column today if you look it just of the fundamentals you look at     what the economy is like how much money the consumer has to stand     where interest rates are you know if you d had these conditions ten years ago or twenty years ago     you would have expected     the and are meant to be pretty good for the slowdown in the job market looks pretty good rate now wages are going up gas prices and low consumer spending is really healthy rate now i mean these are all conditions that normally for a retailer would be great people are spending on this is excellent     so but it just goes to show that people are spending on different things now than they were say twenty years ago all we also talked on this podcast not long ago about the separation between goods and services and comes to if inflation purses deflation which is occurring in goods     so you know these guys are pillars of goods     and add their prices are going down     and so another interesting thing the thing about with nice is that they have     the transition at the top of a new ceo this can be coming in next year     and so on you know a lot of these moves made today     should theoretically benefit the new leadership team that s coming in place starting in twenty seventeen solat east are causes closings or not can happen in school early next year so     but once the new ceo steps and     he will have     you know a smaller fleet of stores and more focus on e commerce so     that that s out a lot of costs for that that was the store is a     bit there been any eliminating i read a billion dollars in revenue by closing the stores sell on the one hand in a lot of retailers as are reluctant to get rid of that by you know you cut out a huge amount of kosmina comes inventory buying and holding in     aam you know     that even the lights on all these things as clearly as short as any hints of the store short term pain long term gain right that s the that s the thinking here so what s in it does this mean that macy s problems are solved immediately probably not based on a lot more to do but     in terms of taking appropriate steps i think that macy s did more than people were anticipating this morning     and that s why you re seeing that the stock is up sixteen percent are somewhat about kohl s     so calls and it s interesting because because their     results were not as good as macy s and actually lowered their outlook for the year     which you would think would be     disappointed in the news hit the stock shot up immediately in premarket trade after the release the report     and it s up there and its continued skeins that they get into a beaded bead on top and bottom line for the quarter so so that was and i think there has seen sir sales were down but not as good as people not as bad as death on a new scene aliso across all of retail live the stocks which have been hit so hard for so long now     are getting a bit of a relief     rally here on thursday so     what will and when you see things like this it s like i it s easy to go the worst is over meetings grade again inside this might not be the turnaround exactly     right and and and that s on that point the meaning there s there s tactics of the strata germany people like with the with their hearing today     but if you ask     in your column is this good is that the error and it     is the old me know the industry     kind of over and     using in jakarta soars on a hundred fifty years old right and and that was they served and were really good purpose     at the time the place you can     buy everything even as retail change the point that people don t want to cuddle mall and walked into a jc penney s or or     or or macy s and     get this year and that they re the don t you don t is not a reason for it to exist as such     i mean that s certainly the the amazon to read write a mean it s much easier to just go online click a button and you get your gear maker ion images can design but the internet as a whole day you know why why have a department store when you have the internet     oh what were the reason or another that i     write is actually right this year you can have the specialty stores recipe rental go do some of those are in trouble to people go to     a specialty store store that just as the right and and among the others that just as wide you don t eat that one that     is a jack of all trades and in this that is that the usually with with a lot of malls across the us so     our colleague suzanne kapner had the story a few weeks ago talking about how a lot of mall operators are pushing out     these big department stores and instead of filling them with either specialty retailers for food courts are other things that are     still attracting people to comments although the foot traffic when you think write and when the settlers specialty stores to differentiate themselves purses amazon because they re not selling generic every kind you know like     you know shirts and sweaters are selling via whatever the specific style that brand sells verses you know than the general friday and i know i think back to was four years ago now that ron johnson came to j c penney destroyed in the business and was left in the bottom in but     he made the point he wanted to turn into a bunch of small stores     was that was it was he perhaps     you know     a little early but     possibly write about it     about the outing that s that that s a tough i mean you re a ca i mean what he did the j c penney has     and     i think in question is more candid could someone have turned j c penney hinted that     the new star will continue taking e and the basis of     an existing fleet of department stores and transform it into     a bunch of specialty stores maybe not i mean it s easier to start from the ground     we are going to take a quick break when we come back more on the future of department store this     time is suppose to go most of the potomac watch podcast join me in my colleagues every

you another tough question do you think department stores will still exist in their current form fifteen year span     fifteen years from now i     mean that hammer out a twenty twenty thirty one     mm i id it s can be very different i think i think that if you do see then there ll be a lot fewer department stores and are now i mean they re just talking     today in twenty sixteen about macy s cutting the hundred stores     i think that macy s will be around in some way shape or form fifteen years from now but certainly a lot fewer stores than     in what they have and     what he think spencer didn t you agree with that     he i think ill be around because adding it s a great brand name of is nothing wrong with the brand name but i think that     aam you go home     and went to macy s recently for the first time in years and to     buy some clothing for my son and i just was surprised at how pour the selection was     of each individual thing i mean we have the key is to sort of scratch your head you know why my shopping i know that s the criticism really that nice is getting to know that the experience is just not that great the stores are kept up as well as people remember out the use to get so that that will need to i think that something that they can change but you know you even have nordstrom which hasn t had that reputation at its had also similar     problems in recent quarters     so i d i     don t know i think the department store as a concept     might not exist anymore i mean i call a department store is dead i d i d i might     think i mean you     know i think the things they can be when it might be longer than fifteen years but i think that concept can be phased out when you select a lot of department stores die     you think of like     the war worse sin than dillard s and you know they re     they re not brand these grandson live forever looking right let s come back in fifteen years we adults had mostly hear him if he didn t announce that
