 recently introduced a grungy  graffiti themed d  cor to restaurants across its european market  the company hailed the new design as    exciting and fresh    graffiti artists have a different description for the burger chain   s faux graffiti plastered walls  copyright infringement the design scheme  officially titled    extreme    in mcdonald   s brochures  is meant to target youthful consumers by using    graffiti like visual language on the walls to remind people that mcdonald   s is a brand of the streets     as the company   s former chief brand strategist for europe explained  what mcdonald   s may not have anticipated is that the street is undergoing its own branding revolution  artists who view the urban landscape as a giant canvas are no longer outlaws in the dusk  but are increasingly showcased in museums and galleries and pursued by deep pocketed art buyers  the embrace of graffiti has made artists more possessive of their designs  more sensitive to their reputation and  along with the higher stakes  more inclined to sue mcdonald   s is the defendant in the latest of a growing handful of graffiti copyright clashes  in one recent case  the plaintiff is the former girlfriend of the late rebel artist dash snow  the suit accuses mcdonald   s of painting him as a corporate sellout and putting his legacy at risk  jade berreau  the administrator of his estate and mother of his only child  alleges that hundreds of mcdonald   s restaurants across the globe are adorned with replica images of    sace      the tag  or signature  used by mr  snow  he died in      at the age of    mr  snow  the lawsuit says  would never have consented to what it calls a    brazen    misappropriation of the soho artist   s    original graphic expression        nothing is more antithetical to mr  snow   s outsider    street cred         says the complaint  filed last week in los angeles federal court     than association with corporate consumerism   of which mcdonald   s and its marketing are the epitome    mcdonald   s said its graffiti d  cor  which also includes scrawl on hanging light fixtures  is one of a dozen interior design motifs recently introduced as part of a broader re imaging of stores  a company spokeswoman declined to comment on the litigation a similar infringement action was brought against the company in march by  eric rosenbaum  a los angeles tattoo artist also known as norm  he alleged in federal court there that mcdonald   s ripped off a graffiti work he titled    n o r m fire escape on bartlett    over boarded up windows on a vacant brooklyn building mr  rosenbaum said he spotted an image that looked suspiciously like    norm    on a wall at a tokyo mcdonald   s several years ago  similar    tags     or letters in graffiti parlance  are splashed on mcdonald   s walls in france and london  too  mr  rosenbaum doesn   t object to the commodification of his work     since       norm has been a street artist for hire     his complaint says  listing companies such as coca cola co  and rockstar inc  as past employers the problem  his lawyers contended  was that mcdonald   s alleged    unauthorized use    of norm stained his reputation and caused the artist to lose several six figure licensing deals and contracts mr  rosenbaum   s lawyers withdrew the lawsuit in may  they declined to elaborate  the plaintiff in the snow case  meanwhile  appears to be digging in    our highest priority is securing the immediate removal of this artwork from all mcdonald   s stores to prevent any further trauma to dash   s family or his legacy     said  jeff gluck  the lawyer representing ms  berreau art dealer  jeffrey deitch  former director of the museum of contemporary art  los angeles  said some street artists are so antiestablishment that they refuse to allow their work to be displayed at all  others  he said  are more amenable and will work for a corporation   if they feel the project has    the right attitude    and authenticity  commercial misuse can be    morally offensive to them     said mr  deitch an early booster of the genre  mr  deitch  while at moca  co curated a major exhibit of graffiti and other street art  in new york  he invited mr  snow and collaborator  dan colen to turn his grand street gallery into a giant hamster nest  mr  snow  a scion of arts aristocracy  he was a great grandson of french american arts patron and oil industry heiress  dominique de menil   acquired a reputation as the     kurt cobain    of the new york gallery world as a teen  he roamed subway tunnels and rooftops  snapping polaroids and spraying his    sace    tag  his photographs  collages and sculptures often contained scabrous images of sex and hard drugs  or featured his own body fluids some art critics see mr  snow as a shock mongering poseur  his admirers say he effectively captured a post      sense of angst and doom  museums like the whitney in new york and london   s saatchi gallery have also promoted his work  one piece  a defiled new york post cover of  saddam hussein  sold for        last month at  sotheby   s

 other snow works have commanded six figures mr  snow   s mystique also extended to his reckless lifestyle  which ultimately doomed him  in july       his family confirmed reports that he had died of a drug overdose the perceived association with mcdonald   s has    diminished the value of mr  snow   s work     ms  berreau   s complaint alleges  in a statement made through her lawyer  she said that suing was a last resort  ms  berreau   s lawsuit alleges    straightforward copyright infringement     but proving that may not be so simple  said  christopher buccafusco  an intellectual property scholar at cardozo school of law in new york who isn t involved in the case for ms  berreau to prevail  he said  she   ll have to show that mcdonald   s interior designers copied the    sace    logo and also prove that the tag in question possesses an originality distinguishable from generic graffiti     courts and the u s  copyright office have been pretty resistant to the notion that the design of letters is copyrightable     the professor said if mcdonald   s prevails  that won   t guarantee a win in the court of public opinion  the company was on the defensive earlier this year when a brixton location in south london got a graffiti makeover some residents saw it as misguided pandering     in an inner city area like brixton  tagging is a bit of blight     said  jay rayner  restaurant critic for london   s observer and longtime brixton resident  while he admires some graffiti in the area as    fantastic     he deems mcdonald   s indoor tagging to be    just a bit crass    a mcdonald   s spokeswoman defended the aesthetic  saying that the new look had been generally well received   write to jacob gershman at jacob gershman wsj com
