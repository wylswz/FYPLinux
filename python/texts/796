articles when patients take too many pills doctors deprescribe           your doctor wants you to stop taking so many medications  more health care providers are adopting an approach known as de prescribing to help adults in the u s  and elsewhere reduce excessive use of prescription drugs and over the counter medications and supplements  studies show nearly     of patients in their   s take more than five medications doctors conduct comprehensive medication reviews  using screening programs to identify possible side effects and interactions  then wean patients off drugs that are unnecessary or where risks outweigh benefits    what was good for you once might not be as good for you now     says  cara tannenbaum  a geriatrician and the scientific director of the institute of gender and health at the canadian institutes of health research in montreal     on a regular basis  patients should be asking their health care providers     is this still the right drug for me  and if not  what other drug or nondrug therapies are safer and equally effective         dr  tannenbaum and pharmacist  barbara farrell have developed a website  deprescribing org  which is maintained by the canadian deprescribing network  a group that includes health professionals  policy makers and patient advocates  the site  used by doctors in both the u s  and canada  provides information to help patients determine if they should consider stopping certain medications that may be unnecessary or cause harm  including a common medication for heartburn or reflux called a proton pump inhibitor and certain diabetes drugs that increase the risk for low blood sugar medication use can start to pile up in middle age or earlier  especially in patients being treated for diabetes  heart disease or cancer  people may see different doctors who don   t coordinate care with each other  soon  they are in a situation known as polypharmacy  defined as five or more drugs  the body processes many drugs less efficiently as it ages  leading to problems with long term medications  statins  prescribed to control cholesterol  may not be needed over age     and they can cause muscle weakness and increase the risk of falls  after a major medical setback  even young patients may have little choice but to take multiple medications   janice taylor      had a stroke in      and a heart attack in       she has had to take about a dozen medications  with side effects including fatigue  nausea  dizziness and memory and judgment issues     a lot of things i take are necessary  but quite often my doctors and i sit down and look over everything     says ms  taylor  who volunteers for the american heart association and is a facilitator for a stroke support group in virginia beach  va  ms  taylor says doctors changed her blood pressure medication  which was causing her pressure to fluctuate  to a combination of two drugs that stabilized her condition without heavy side effects  she also has stopped taking powerful prescription medications for migraines  which were giving her hallucinations  substituting an extra strength over the counter medication  she is also now taking a third of her original dose of a muscle relaxer  prescribed after her stroke for involuntary muscle contractions  to manage multiple side effects  she divides her drug regimen into morning and evening  and times her meetings around hours of the day when she isn   t feeling the effects as strongly  and she is vigilant about exercise  rest  meditation and a nutritious diet to keep up her strength  the american geriatrics society last year updated its beers criteria  a list of    medications or classes of drugs that are potentially inappropriate for older adults  an expert panel is working on an update for       last year  after reviewing       research studies  the panel added three new drugs and two new classes of medications to warning lists for older people or people with specific health concerns  the panel also issued guidelines on    drug combinations and published a new list of    medications older adults should avoid or use with caution  those lists and suggested alternative medications and nonprescription treatment options are available at healthinaging org  michael steinman  co chair of the beers panel and a professor in the division of geriatrics at the university of california  san francisco  cautions that regimens have to be tailored to individual patients     we don   t know in advance if a patient is going to have side effects  and some drugs are more effective on certain patients than others      dr  steinman says  a study led by dr  tannenbaum  known as the empower trial  for eliminating medications through patient ownership of end results  suggests that directly educating consumers can help reduce overuse of risky medications  the study  published in jama internal medicine in       included     long term users of benzodiazepine  a type of sedative  ages    to     recruited from    community pharmacies  of those randomized to immediately receive a brochure about risks      initiated a conversation with a doctor or pharmacist about stopping the drug  at six months      had discontinued use compared with    of a wait list control group  in addition to caution about sedatives in older adults  doctors have new warnings about the widely prescribed proton pump inhibitors  studies show a link between the medications and an increased risk for bone loss  fractures  and serious bacterial infections  they can also change the way other drugs work  such as reducing the effect of blood thinning drugs and increasing the risk of heart attack and death  holly m  holmes  chair of the division of geriatric and palliative medicine at mcgovern medical school at university of texas health science center at houston  says patients are often prescribed a proton pump inhibitor while in the hospital to treat a short term problem with heartburn or reflux     but then they end up staying on them forever     because stopping drugs suddenly can worsen symptoms  dr  holmes explains to patients that they need to gradually taper down over several weeks to avoid a rebound effect  she also suggests diet and lifestyle changes  in medication reviews with patients  she focuses on their priorities     if my patient is having profound fatigue  the top of my list for deprescribing is whatever medications might be contributing to that     dr  holmes says    andrew whitman  a doctor of pharmacy and clinical specialist in palliative care at the university of maryland baltimore washington medical center says medication reviews are especially important for older cancer patients  who on average take    medications and are often frail from radiation and chemotherapy  but it isn   t just about reducing quantities of medication  sedatives and drugs that prevent nausea  for example  are on the list of potentially inappropriate medications for older adults because they cause dizziness  confusion and blurred vision  still  they may be needed for nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy deprescribing guidelines are useful    to help flag which medications we want to target for stopping or reducing the dose     dr  whitman says     the goal is to keep patients as healthy as possible on the least number of medications     write to laura landro at laura
