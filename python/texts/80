donald trump did not just magically become a despicable  racist  misogynistic  homophobic  asshole overnight  it   s not something that he has just developed as part of his campaign  he   s always been like this  it   s literally been part of his schtick for like     years donald trump did not just magically become the republican nominee for president  he was put there by people who believe in the same things he does  who support him  and who genuinely want him to lead this country donald trump is just being donald trump  he is running his campaign  participating in debates  running his sphincter of a mouth exactly in the manner one would expect him to         assuming you were at least somewhat aware of him prior to this election year he   s just as morally repugnant as ever  and just as indignant about it of course  that   s just how his supporters like him  when they say they like trump because he    tells it like it is     and that he doesn   t worry about being    politically correct    all the time  what they mean to say is that he is not just openly racist  homophobic  sexist  and ableist         he   s fucking proud of it people like trump because he gives them permission to no longer suppress their intolerance  he promotes pride in prejudice there are people more dangerous than donald trump  and they are people you interact with in your community  they are people who you know  they might even be members of your family or your friends even if trump does not become president  his supporters will still exist  and they will have been invigorated by the rhetoric of this campaign  trump has made them brave  hillary clinton has made them angry whenever a trump dumpster fire erupts  consider what   s being said  then realize that those people in your life who support him are having a direct impact on you and the people you love there are men in your community who would use their positions of power  or even just their white  male  privilege which gives them power anyway  to look at you  or your daughter  and say they   d    grab them by the pussy    given the opportunity  maybe they wouldn   t even need the opportunity  because when men are powerful they    can do anything    there are men who look at you and think you   re    disgusting    or a    pig     they either think your daughter is also disgusting         or  that they   d like to    try and fuck her     they   d    move on her like a bitch    consider that your child may be in a classroom with someone who knowingly excludes the narratives of native people from their curriculum  who white washes history  who downplays the achievements of people of color  who subtly or not so subtly asserts their white supremacism into your child   s life  perhaps their sunday school teacher promotes homosexuality as a sin without actually explaining homosexuality at all look at your parents  did they teach you to be afraid  did they point out people in the grocery store  in your church  in your school and say things to you like    laziness is a trait in blacks     or    they   re bringing drugs  they   re bringing crime  they   re rapists    do you still believe those things  what   s your knee jerk reaction when you see a black man on the street  what do think when you hear a mother speaking spanish to her child at the store  when you see a a woman wearing a hijab trump is not the problem  he   s the result of a systemic problem  of which we are all a part  if you aren   t actively against what he stands for  you   re part of the problem  if you are silent  you are tolerating hate this doesn   t just go for this election  either  this all predated donald trump and it will continue when this election is over  even if he doesn   t win  the only hope we have that it won   t be insurmountable is to make sure he doesn   t win  but remember that the people who support him will be angry  fueled  and ready to fight in his honor it wouldn   t take a trump presidency to throw us into a trump world we   re already living in it now that this piece has made the the rounds  a lot of trump supporters are slidin    into my dms like     you can   t lump us all into one category     and    we aren   t all like that    look  if you support donald trump  i can   t be sure that you   re not a racist  sexist  homophobic  islamophobe  so it   s safer to just assume  for now  that you   re all like that         see what i   m saying tell me  how does it feel  pretty bad  i bet you don   t like being judged based on what some of the other people who share your beliefs have done well  guess it   s a good thing i   m not running for president  can you imagine voting for someone who    abby norman is a journalist and writer  she   s currently working on a
