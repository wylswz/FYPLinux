original interview  http   www techiesproject com enrique allen tell me about your early years and where you come from i was born at home in san leandro  in the east bay  just south of oakland  so i   m a bay area native  i have three sisters who were also born at home  one older and two younger  i soon moved to hayward where my parents still live now  and grew up going to the new haven unified school district because my mom taught there  and she taught everything from performing arts to working with kids at risk and is now doing dropout prevention  my dad is a doctor and his practice is in fremont  so we   d commute from hayward not too far to union city i would say looking back now one of my formative things about my upbringing is that i   m mixed  i   m part native american  san carlos apache from arizona  eastern band cherokee from the carolinas  hawaiian a couple generations but originally from cebu  which are islands off the philippines and japanese from osaka  and english  hence my last name  apparently some bastard blood from king henry v or something crazy like that  my aunt  i think  did a bunch of family trees but at some point  everyone connects back i think given that ethnically diverse background  my parents    approach to raising us was grounded more in a common indigenousity  a common indigenous approach to simply having a connection to this earth and to this land  so we grew up farming our whole hillside  everything from beans and corn that are way taller than me  tomatoes and kale and all sorts of greens and squash  all different types of flowers and succulents  it   s still thriving to this day  growing up  it was really annoying to go into the backyard and do all of our compost and create our own soil  but i got a chance to help build that little organic garden it was frustrating being out there in the backyard watering  when other kids are playing and i was always out there working  though i think it did ground me and i still have a deep connection and sense of place on this earth  it also reinforced a farmer   s work ethic from my dad and his father who farmed on the eastern shore of maryland  so there was definitely some influence from my dad and influence from my mom  she   s a performing artist so i have the analytical side from my dad and the creative side from my mom  while i was a baby  she took me around on tour and she would do different types of modern performances  integrating dance  poetry  theater  and native influenced stories  my mom was just so generous with everyone  i remember growing up being so annoyed that we   d have people over to our house all the time  staying at our place or coming over for brunch  she   d really try to take care of people and give as much to the local communities as possible  to this day she   s dropping off car loads of food  clothes and gifts for people all the time  when i was a kid i think i was annoyed but now i realize it had a much bigger impact on me in terms of my perspective on giving  even when you don   t think you have anything to give where we lived was also interesting in the sense that we were in the foothills so our area really felt quite safe and unique  every home was uniquely built  in one sense i felt secure in our middle class lifestyle  but then on the other hand  near us or below us in the surrounding areas of where i went to school and other parts of hayward and oakland there was much more disparity so i felt like i got to see a pretty big spectrum growing up and then going into school in union city  the elementary school i went to was in decoto which had some notorious gangs and unfortunately some violence  so i think i was also exposed to that just walking around from daycare to school or staying after school i think i was super lucky as a kid  my parents put me in a chinese preschool  i have a few vague memories of making chinese symbols  so that was interesting  and then with kindergarten  there was a morning session and an afternoon session but my mom was working at school so i just stuck around for both sessions  i think as early as first grade i started staying after school in math club with mr  fogel who was able to make a lot of things  even algebra  super accessible and fun  using tactile blocks and objects  i think those things probably were also formative early on  it   s silly to me to even think about that because for most kids who go to amazing schools now that   s probably the norm  but for a public school with a big population of immigrants and english as a second language and super diverse minority school  i think those kind of after school programs were unique eventually i took a gate test that put me onto a whole other track from elementary school all the way through high school  it   s pretty crazy to me to think that probably fundamentally altered my whole course  i was in  nd grade but then i got moved to a  rd grade class  and so  it just started accelerating from there to the honors track all the way through high school  the environment of those classes is very different than the other classes that were probably more chaotic  a lot crazier  with diversity of levels of knowledge and access  so  it   s crazy to me to think that things like that exist and hopefully they   re still getting funding  a lot of those kids went onto berkeley  i was the only kid to go to stanford out of a high school class of maybe      plus students  which is unfortunate  i think more folks should have the ability to go there the other thing that probably shaped my perspective on how i operate now is that my parents didn   t take care of everything for me and hover  i don   t know what these things are called  hoverboard parents or helicopter parents  laughter  hoverboard parents   it   s the      version yeah exactly  rather than my mom making me lunch in the morning  i would make lunch for me and my mom and i don   t know if they were intentionally doing that or not  but that principle of empowering me  or putting the responsibility on me to take action extended throughout my life  so  for example  as there were a lot of latino kids and a big hispanic community in this decoto area  i remember going out for the first time at recess and somehow being invited to play this ball game  i still have a couple of memories of how exhilarating that was and just cutting and kicking and having a great time  so that naturally inspired me to want to play more soccer  i went to my parents and told them i   d really love to play in a league  i was probably around seven or eight years old  they just told me to go and make it happen  and i   m like  uh  okay  so i remember being so annoyed as a kid that i would always have to fill out the release forms and apply for these things on my own  not to say that they weren   t supportive once i started doing it because then they would come to all of my games and obviously drive me around and buy me gear  but they really wanted me to take that initiative and once i took that initiative they were super supportive the recess soccer games were another small thing that fundamentally changed my trajectory because from that point on  i just started playing more and more soccer  first with a local club  called the patriots  that was my first team  very patriotic  and then i just excelled and got invited to play with a select team  that coach was from germany  coach burnett  and because he came from germany he had such a better understanding of the fundamentals of the game than any american coach  the types of drills and discipline that we would have was just so much better than a lot of the other teams and we did pretty well for not having much in the way of resources  eventually i was noticed by a wealthier club  lamorinda  which is a club in lafayette over the hills of oakland as you go into walnut creek  it   s a very affluent area  i got noticed by that coach and they recruited me to play with them as coach burnett was beginning to wind down his team  so that also then exposed me to a whole other world of wealth  just a whole other extreme than some of the kids that i went to school with  so i felt like i really got to see a pretty big spectrum of socio economic status with that team we traveled to many places around the world  to europe  to barcelona in spain multiple times  to sweden multiple times  that wasn   t always easy  i remember having to fundraise from my parents    friends and family  it wasn   t easy compared to the other teammates whose parents would just pay for them to go on these trips  but nevertheless  i think it really opened my eyes to different cultures  whether in south america or in europe  i think that also fundamentally shifted my perspective  i remember being in sweden  just amazed about how clean and how easy the public transportation system was and how friendly everybody was  i was just like     wow     how beautiful the people were  it was amazing  i had such a good time there and continue to go back when i can the next big shift was playing in these tournaments like the dallas cup  that got me noticed by some coaches from stanford  i started developing relationships with those folks  i got hurt in my senior year of high school  i hurt my lateral meniscus in a tournament  and so  that was right at the time when i was in conversations with recruiting  who encouraged me to apply  i had exceptional grades like most kids who first get into stanford but what i could get from financial aid was actually bigger than what i could get from a scholarship to play soccer  i think soccer influenced me getting into stanford  but i think that the academic merit also equally contributed to getting in  so that was a cool to start another trajectory it   s so interesting to me  how much exposure you had to both the lowest socioeconomic status in school and the highest socioeconomic status through soccer yeah  like some of the mansions  and private this and private that   chuckles  to other people immigrating from central america  or elsewhere and really having to struggle  and you have to learn how to hang with both i think i went through different phases in school  wanting to be more cool and rebellious and wear baggy clothes and get into rap music  i definitely went through that phase  i definitely had my fair share of getting into trouble  whether it was pranks or doing things that we weren   t of age to be doing  there was a point before actually going to high school where i did get into a little trouble and i remember my parents picking me up at school and just crying and bawling  this is all while i   m getting straight a   s but i had this kind of dual personality of being exceptional in the classroom but also wanting to be cool with the cool kids and the influence of gangs and other sorts of stuff in schools  anyways  i remember my parents just bawling and being so upset with me  it was the first time i realized that my actions have an impact on other people  so i think that was the big sort of ah ha moment before going into high school  i just felt so grateful that i had that experience before it was too late  i thought     hey  i   ve got to be more responsible  i can   t just go along with some of these bad crowds  i   ve got to make decisions for myself and recognize that i have to take responsibility for my actions     that was a huge turning point that helped keep me straight through high school because i didn   t want to have that type of experience again  i felt really lucky that it wasn   t anything that affected my record did you have any idea at that point what you wanted to be  was there a specific point you became interested in design or technology it   s pretty crazy  i   d go to stanford for occasional events like native american pow wows  i   d been on the campus  but for whatever reason i thought that stanford was just all doctors  lawyers  and business people  i was totally unaware of engineering or design as a track  i don   t even recall using the word design  i was definitely exposed to art and performing arts because of my sisters and my mom  but yeah  even today  to just realize that when you   re in the valley and you think everyone knows about all this shit  many kids around this area and in east bay probably don   t i would say also one other thing that influenced me and my three sisters was that my mom came from a lineage of really strong  independent women  my grandmother on my mom   s side  was a nurse and she raised them by herself single handedly  with my great grandmother  it   s kind of the same thing  in arizona  she had her own home and was really independent  horses and cattle and riding around  i think that matriarchy and having three sisters also shaped my values and perspective on gender  it has continued to play into some of the work that we do to this day  investing in diversity  i think just having more respect for women  my dad was just more reserved and calm and zen like  my mom was much more of the fiery one that would really take the initiative on things  so i think that   s also had an influence  but yeah  back to the question on how i got interested in design so getting to stanford was amazing  and with influence from my dad  i thought maybe i should go down the pre med track  i started off with human biology  which is a really great major at stanford that   s pretty interdisciplinary and i finished most of my pre med requirements  from stuff in the lab to all the fundamentals  i also took a lot of courses at the medical school and that was when i started to realize that i wasn   t sure i wanted to be in these lab settings  it didn   t resonate as much with me at the same time too  that shit was kind of hard  i went from not studying ever to being with some of the best students in the world  so  i definitely remember being kind of shocked like     oh  wow     i actually need to do some work here and at the same time playing division one soccer  that was challenging  i remember waking up super early for practice and after that i   d go to class  i would just be so tired  so sleepy and that was really challenging one of my teammates  bronson mcdonald was volunteering at this local non profit called mural music   arts project in east palo alto  he was helping start their history through hip hop program  he invited me to come out to some of the mural making that was going on at that time  that was the first time that i experienced research process like primary research  trying to figure out the local stories related to the theme like immigration which was a controversial theme at that time  interviewing experts and local folks  and synthesizing all that  getting everybody   s ideas out  and then visualizing it  that was the first time that i got exposed to the word design because that was a mural design process  so from the research to the design  to scale it on the wall  to unveiling it and having a big celebration that was when i first started having an awareness of the design process  it was just so powerful for me to spend time with local at risk youth which again is this conundrum in one of the wealthiest cities  all these resources and then to have a place so nearby where there   s so much disparity  it continued on this theme of having access to the folks at stanford who are like princes and other crazy stuff  to folks that just don   t have the same level of privilege at all  through the mural project i started to continue to volunteer and i started to realize  as they were applying for grants  there was this community technology foundation of california  ctfc  i looked around at my friends at stanford  a lot of my friends didn   t go to east palo alto  they had no exposure to these stories  i   m like  is anybody actually going to come walk into the    ghetto    to look at some of these beautiful mural art pieces  and even if they do walk up to the wall  they   re not going to have a sense of all the stories and the meaning behind the wall  i thought what if we start putting these murals online  and started to think about a virtual mural tour  that   s when i started trying to apply the design process more to the web in software  i started hacking google maps which wasn   t open at the time and using different tools along with a couple of folks at the mural music and arts project like zach pogue and others  we pitched and got a grant to develop a project and document  digitally  many of the murals in the local ravenswood city school district and up the peninsula to try to be able to expose these stories more digitally  that was the first web project that started to get me excited about the power of technology and power of software concurrently i   d say one of my good friends from stanford  dan greenberg  introduced me to professor bj fogg at stanford who   s done a lot around persuasive technology and how you can use technology for good  i ended up taking a facebook class which is where i started to cross paths with ben blumenfeld  my co founder at designer fund  that class was the first time that facebook had opened up their platform for third party developers  our objective was to build applications from scratch and launch them on the facebook platform  we formed a small team  i basically worked on a status message app that has all the features that we kind of take for granted now  like embedding photos  linking  replies  that kind of stuff  collectively with classmates who worked on a bunch of other projects  we got something like    million users in    weeks  mainly making these spammy apps like hugs and kisses  but i think that had a huge impact on me because it was the first time i realized that we could have this mass interpersonal impact  i can   t think of another class in history that has reached that many people with the help of bj  i started to do research in his lab on these mechanisms of how can you use social applications to get people to do good things  so  it really started to open my eyes to the power of software and that   s when i began to shift my courses into human computer interaction  i started to meet other people that were part of this small major at the time  it was inter disciplinary between cs  linguistics  psychology and i started to take as many classes as i could in that track  that   s when i started to get more formal training in usability and user research  around the same time at the end of that facebook class  i presented my project and i got noticed by chris o   malley  who was at venrock  venrock is one of the oldest vc firms  they   ve invested in apple  they   re from the lineage of rockefeller money  he invited me to come on over  have lunch and meet the team  i didn   t have any awareness about venture capital  or really much about startups  even though we did these kind of social apps  this is probably around      or so  i worked in house at venrock with the senior designer and a couple of developers  and we would basically help build product for some of the companies that they were incubating  i spent most of my time with askmego  which is a live questions and answer site  it was great  i got to help acquire a few hundred thousand users  similar to aardvark which was acquired by google  i worked on helping people get their questions answered and how to surface really good questions  that was a great first experience in tech so you joined facebook fund during college as well i then went back to grad school because i wanted to play for one more year  i got hurt one year at stanford  so i wanted to play a  th year of soccer  and i also wanted to keep going deeper into design  i lived off campus and was biking down lytton ave in palo alto  near the old techcrunch office and i ran into dave mcclure on the street  who i knew from the facebook class  he was like     hey  what are you up to  want to help work on this thing  facebook fund     i was like     that sounds cool     but i just brushed it off  on top of everything that i was doing  playing soccer  taking super intense classes  then getting more into hci  and doing research in the lab  i also worked most of the time  and paid my way through school one of the side jobs i had was at a high end catering company that would do a lot of on campus events  there was actually a vc related event that i was catering and i was learning about some of the start ups and then i ran into dave mcclure again  and he was like     hey  man  you should probably come over and learn more and help out on facebook fund     at that point i finally followed up  but i think it   s just crazy to me to think that you could have those kinds of serendipitous opportunities that are connections from class and you run into people on the street  the density of awesome people that you have access to is so easy to take for granted then i joined dave to help run design for    fbfund     which was a joint venture between facebook  accel and founders fund  there were around    companies we invested in and i was responsible for running a small in house design team to do short sprints with the portfolio companies around user acquisition  retention and revenue  it was amazing because i got to see all these companies in their infancy  when it was just a couple people around the table  little companies like zimride with logan and john before they turned into the multi billion dollar company lyft  little companies like run my errand with leah before she turned it into taskrabbit  alain and the wildfire team before they grew it and sold it to google for hundreds of millions  it   s crazy to see those companies form from the ground up facebook wanted to have these companies build their products with    social    built into the product  facebook connect  the little button that you see around to log in everywhere was new at the time  so they wanted more companies to showcase that  this is also when i started to realize that i needed to scale myself  i couldn   t serve all    companies  it wasn   t possible  so i started to think how could i take a lot of the learnings from the design school  how could i take a lot of that design thinking and prove that it works in the context of early stage start ups  that includes office hours  talks  workshops  etc  i brought over whiteboards that i borrowed from the d school  scott doorley who is now the creative director was so gracious to literally let me come with a truck and pick up a bunch of their equipment and take it over to facebook  i had to figure out how to scale design and with the success of facebook fund  dave went on to start his own fund as i was finishing up grad school  i was also starting to go deeper into design  i took a course  entrepreneurial design for extreme affordability  on one hand  i   m exposed to of all these social apps that are scaling and on the other end of the extreme  i   m working on low cost water pumps  storage  and irrigation for rural farmers in burma  myanmar   it was a year long course where we did a lot of research  prototyping  testing  and went out to burma during spring break  being out in the field trying to empathize with people rather than just trying to push our solution onto them  really trying to understand their needs  i remember sitting there in the field  observing this young girl  who was probably the same age as my sister at the time  a young teen  or maybe even younger  squat down and pick up gallons and gallons of water on her shoulder  she would go back and forth with tons of water over the course of a day  that   s one of the big things keeping her from going to school  i just had empathy for her  especially given that i had a sister too  around her age  that again informed my perspective on what is meaningful impact  what   s the power of these technologies to really fundamentally affect people   s lives  i continued to do projects like that through grad school  for example in south africa with frontlinesms medic  i worked on mobile texting apps to help virtual health workers report infectious diseases  another amazing experience  that was another thing that opened my eyes to the power of technology to help  walking into some of those hospitals and seeing people on stretchers  i think it grounded me in terms of technology that actually matters  that makes a difference  versus technology that just plays at our egos and our vices after finishing up grad school  i remember working harder during that time period  than ever  of course  not sleeping  and all of the classic things  anyway      startups didn   t have a brand  or even a name  we didn   t have a logo mark  or a typeface  or a website  or any money in the bank  or any space  or anything  the job  really  was just to do everything that i could  to help get     startups off the ground  launching our site  designing and helping close on        square feet in mountain view  and doing that buildout  i really credit dave  to just empower me  during my time there  i focused on our accelerator program and the problem of how to scale design services  how to scale great design  to dozens of companies at a time i experimented with everything  design sprints  talks  workshops  pattern libraries  ui kits  all sorts of things  it was great  i got to work with companies like punchd  that was acquired by google  and invested in b  hance  which was acquired by adobe  i worked with tiny post  acquired by trip advisor  i got a chance to not only help hands on with companies  but also start to invest  one day while meditating at my place in palo alto  i just had this a ha moment  which was like  shit  am i having long term impact with these companies  if i follow up  three  six months or a year down the road  how many of these companies will still be practicing these human centered methods  what i noticed was that it was exponential decay  you would improve someone   s design sense  or their awareness of customers  but then if no one on the team was there to help sustain it  and to continue modeling and practicing these design behaviors  it   s not sustainable  people would just revert back to whatever they   re comfortable with  if you have an engineering background  you   re probably just going to focus more on solving problems from an engineering perspective  or a business perspective  it really bummed me out  that as i started to look back  i   m like  man  i   ve been working on all these companies over the past few years  but am i having long term impact with them in one of the books that i was reading at the time  disrupt  or one of the conversations with john lilly  the lesson was to do the opposite of what you   ve been doing  i was like  okay  i   ve been spending all of this time trying to make startups more design oriented  what if i do the opposite and help designers take the path of entrepreneurship with the thesis being if they get involved earlier on with great engineers and business people  they   ll increase the probability that they could make better designed products and services in the long run  that would also make my job a lot easier rather than trying to parachute in and solve people   s design problems  they would build that core competency in house simultaneously  ben   s and my path crossed multiple times  at the facebook class  facebook fund and we even collaborated on projects like peace facebook com  we kept in touch felt similar challenges and started to interview over    designers that we really respected and tried to understand why aren   t more designers taking this path of entrepreneurship  it kind of boiled down to lack of education  role models and capital  if you look at most of the most of the sources of capital  even going into schools  it   s primarily engineering based  when you look at professors and programs  they weren   t really preparing designers to start companies or to join companies early on  or to be designers in the way that we expect them to be now  every designer we spoke to was like     hey  if you try to solve this challenge  i   ll help you with time and or money     that was really encouraging  all these early conversations with influencers like scott belsky and others who said     yes  i   ll help     i just remember thinking back  like     wow     if those people didn   t say     yes i   ll help     and want to pay it forward and give back to the design community  i don   t think that we would have continued on  that eventually led to ben to take a sabbatical because he was maybe the fifth or sixth designer there and had been there for five or six years  he wanted to take a little break  we started going on hikes like hidden villa in los altos and then maybe working one day a week and then two days a week and then three  and it turned into all of our time trying to figure out how we can help more designers build businesses with meaningful impact walk me through the decision to officially start designer fund it was around      that we were doing the designer interviews  we felt like there was a real need to create a community of designers who were in tech who were building these companies from the ground up or joining early  at the same time  i felt  philosophically  that i wanted to work with less companies  i wanted to have more impact  that means  inherently  there   s just less companies that i can work with  with dave   s blessing  i wanted to start to focus on designer fund full time  over the course of       i started to progressively decrease my time at     startups and increase my time working on designer fund as an independent entity  i   m super lucky that dave along with a number of other awesome investors were early supporters of designer fund  i   m super grateful to dave mcclure  vinod khosla  jonathan heiliger  marc andreessen  eric thomas  shannon callahan  dave morin  chi hua chien  brandon zeuner  ryan swagar  marcus and andrew ogawa  john lilly  alex diehl and many others  folks that  i think  really just believed in the importance of creating an ecosystem and they saw the importance of design and were willing to support different educational events we then started giving grants to designers who were starting companies  for us it was an awesome way to give back to design community through free events  resources like our designer founders ebook  and through grants  as we moved into       we started to formalize some of those things like writing larger grant check sizes and developing a better system for running different types of events  i think that   s when we even started with our first women in design event that maria molfino hosted  we went from mentorship programming to helping set up designers with formal advisorship positions with an equity stake  and also starting to operate as a band of angels where we   d help get our friends to co invest in companies started by designers  we built on that momentum and then by       we started to realize     wow  there   s a huge need need here     our inboxes were full of all these designers who are coming to us seeking support in one way or another  from funding  to transitioning to a new opportunity  to improving their career  and then all these companies were coming to us wanting to build their design teams  and so that led to the genesis of bridge  we had all these great people coming to us but it was just ben and i  we had to create some better way  a more scalable way of doing this  previously i had built some internal tools with kevin xu  who   s now at stripe  and the first version of a way for us to help process applications  we had all these applications for designers who wanted grants and so we thought maybe we can repurpose some of this technology to help us process all these applications from designers and all these applications from companies  that was also another big lesson for me  that some of the technology that you build early on  even if it   s scrappy mvp  really could accrue value over time and really magnify and scale your ability to serve people rather than just trying to do everything manually  that is obvious in retrospect  so we went from experiments in      to formalizing events and grants in      and then we launched bridge and started angel investing in      given our mission is to help designers build businesses with meaningful impact  one way of doing that is by helping designers build companies from the ground up as co founders  what we soon realized was not every designer should be a co founder  and actually  starting a company from scratch is hard as fuck  it   s so hard  at the same time there   s another path  designers join existing companies that are doing well and on a growth trajectory  the next facebook  the next uber  etc  joining one of those companies early on  arguably you could have just as much impact and you   re going to have a great experience learning  you   re going to meet a bunch of awesome designers and engineers  you might have a life changing economic outcome  and just be in a better position to start a company yourself in the future on one hand  investing is great to help designers who are ready to be founders  bridge  on the other hand  is about investing in future design leaders  it also related to our thesis that we believe that companies need to build design at their core  they can   t outsource it  it   s just like you don   t want to outsource your engineering  and great engineers attract other great engineers and so great designers attract other great designers  we felt strongly that helping build and educate design teams would bring a lot of value to companies and help accelerate the growth of designers when we launched bridge  it was an experiment  we didn   t really know what was going to happen  so i just quickly worked with another designer and mocked up a site and worked on the positioning  but i didn   t spend a ton of time on it  i didn   t know if this was actually going to actually going to work  we partnered with some amazing photographers like you  helena price  and with the help of laura brunow miner and others to try to get perspective of a day in the life and what it   s like to be a designer at some of these top companies  like pinterest  airbnb and dropbox  places that we felt truly value design  we   d meet the founders  we   d meet the design team  we   d check out the product  we   d make sure it   s a place where we would want to work ourselves because there   s just so much noise out there and when we launched  it just got an overwhelmingly positive response  way more demand from companies and designers than we could possibly fulfill  it was profitable since day one and we wanted to see if we could do it again  we ended up running another program that same year in       in the fall  again we had amazing results of tons of designers applying  tons of companies wanting to participate  so then we realized that it wasn   t a fluke  again in      when we launched it again  bridge    there was an amazing response  our acceptance rate was tougher than stanford or harvard  we were really solving a need here for companies to help build and educate the design teams  to help designers accelerate their careers and hopefully become better designers and leaders and at the same time too  we started to get more and more companies coming to us seeking funding  they knew that we could actually add value and help build and educate design teams  there   s only so much that ben and i can do as angel investors  there   s only so much we can do by calling up our friends to try to pool our money together to invest in them  so we thought     okay  i think we have enough data here that we   re ready to raise our first fund     that was in       we raised primarily from individual designers  great folks from some of the top companies around the valley  entrepreneurs  a couple of families  our own money and a few institutional funds  now we   re managing over    million and we have a much clearer value proposition for people when they come knocking at our  we can say     hey  we can invest between     k and a million dollars  our average check size is     k     ultimately we wanted to create a better experience for designer founders and designer entrepreneurs we wanted to partner with that was       i think looking back  i don   t think we looked like anything else at the time  i don   t think there was any fund that was focused on design  there was no fund that also had this professional development program that was generating revenue and being profitable and had this community of designers  we just looked very unique  i think  very different compared to the classic fund approaches  we wanted to build this ecosystem  ben and i aren   t mbas or coming from stereotypical investors wearing khakis and a button up shirt every day and vests and stuff  i think people were pretty surprised  i don   t think i was aware at the time  so it   s only looking back that i realize there   s not many diverse investors out there  certainly not at the time from these different design backgrounds  not at the time from an ethnicity perspective  i just met with a friend recently who told me that he   s been doing some research and there   s only about    general partners out there who are hispanic and i was like     uhhhh  oh  okay     i didn   t even know that at the time  so if i factor that stuff in  probably the odds weren   t in our favor  we just didn   t have a long investment track record  we didn   t have a traditional background  didn   t have what people who invest in funds would traditionally look for so thinking back i   m super grateful for all the folks like our advisor  steve vassallo  who took a chance on us and believed in our mission and believed in our approach i guess what i   m trying to say is  each of those steps along the way from venrock  to facebook fund  to     startups to designer fund was uncomfortable  it was a stretch  it was almost that beginners na  vety  looking back i don   t even know if i would do it again  looking back it just doesn   t line up with what the norms at the time there were a lot of sacrifices too  ben and i didn   t really pay ourselves  so many nights just working at our dinner table and doing all the classic stuff that i think any start up needs to do  being super frugal  doing everything that we can to find alternative streams of revenue  engaging our community and a volunteer base  so scrappy  doing events and getting sponsors and if it wasn   t for them i don   t know if i would pay rent that month  just all the things that i think any entrepreneur would have to do  seeing your bank account at zero or negative  in that way i think it was really great for ben and i to have that deep empathy with all the companies that we invest in  i think it   s important never to lose sight of the struggle there   s all this hype that   s going right now and all these folks flocking to silicon valley maybe for the wrong reasons  it   s not a lottery ticket  whereas for us  i don   t think we really ever wanted to be investors just for the sake of being investors  we felt that by investing  we could have a long term impact with these companies  we could have an equity stake and be long term partners versus just consulting and parachuting in for example we have a poster from facebook   s hacker way     we don   t build products to make money  we make money so that we can build better products     i think that   s always resonated with us  where investing is not an end for us  it   s a means for  again  having meaningful impact and ultimately we want better designed products and services in the world  when we say better design  i think of that in a holistic sense  i think of that as an opportunity to impact someone   s life at a really deep level  and the opportunity to have breadth and scale across their life and across the globe  of course we want to make a ton of money and generate great returns  but we think we can do that in a way that is aligned with our values since closing our first fund in       we   ve been able to invest into some really great companies  our largest investment is in stripe  the global payments platform that   s really empowering commerce and online payments around the world  they   re now allowing anyone to set up us businesses and get that off the ground  it   s just amazing  another one of our portfolio companies  zenpayroll which is now re branded as gusto  is helping all these small business owners across the country  many not in tech  run their payroll  that   s really the backbone of the american economy  small businesses  we   re also investors in companies like omada health  which spun out of ideo   s health practice  they help prevent people from getting diabetes  which then saves employers money and makes health plans more efficient  it   s like everybody wins  individuals  the company  society  i just wish i could find ten more of those types of companies in all these different sectors that have  traditionally  been underserved from a user experience standpoint like financial services  education  health  business tools  creative tools  over time i think we   ve been really blessed and fortunate to have lots of great people around the table to support ben and i  an approach that we   ve always taken is that we   ve always surrounded ourselves with people that are amazing at what they do  when we first closed our fund  before even starting to invest  i think we interviewed maybe two dozen top investors that we respected and got perspective on what they thought worked and what didn   t work  we   re constantly practicing our own design process on ourselves and on our own business  we   re not just preaching design  we   re actually being hands on and making our own tools  making our own site  doing a lot of our own stuff  branding for example  i think it   s important to not lose sight of that  we primarily have been focused on just building  helping our companies and letting the work speak for itself  because i think you just see how there   s so much noise out there  we prefer to focus on the fundamentals of building a product that really solves a consumer   s pain point and need so  i have a question  in another interview  the idea was brought up that people tend to invest in what they know  and the problems that they can relate to  from your perspective  with your upbringing and being exposed to so many different socioeconomic backgrounds and cultures and not coming from the silicon valley pedigree         how does that affect you and what you choose to invest your time and money in i think there   s a number of companies that we   ve invested  for example zenpayroll  which is now gusto  we felt the pain of trying set up our own payroll  and file taxes  and all this back end office stuff  it   s like the last thing that we want to do with  especially when you   re really small  so i think in those cases  we felt that pain  even creating our free resources like our designer founder   s e book  we used stripe to process payments  we used some of those tools ourselves as users and that   s one of the things whenever we look at a company         whether or not we   re the target user or not         we really try to use the product  and really dig into all the interactions  which i think it   s pretty surprising how often most investors don   t do that most investors aren   t really product focused and don   t really use the product which continues to surprise us  that   s okay  everyone has a different approach  when you start to dig into a product and start to put yourselves in the shoes of the user  even if we   re not deeply familiar with the problem  we can still try to put ourselves in their shoes and experience what that company is building  i think our ability to empathize with folks who are different than us allows us to imagine how a product or service could really impact someone   s life  hopefully for good of course there   s some things like design tools  for example  like framer studio  we invested in them  and it   s like     yeah  we totally understand the need to prototype mobile web apps with code  with live data where you can make one change really easily and propagate that to a bunch of other things versus static mockups  we totally get that we   re moving towards a world where we need to build interactive prototypes  some things like that  it   s really obvious for us to be able to have a point of view on  but then there   s other things where we   re actively looking for things that are outside our comfort zone  what are those areas that are traditionally underserved from a user experience standpoint  what are the industries with old  dinosaur incumbents that don   t really care about the user and just take advantage of them  insurance  for example  they win based off of advertising campaigns  not on product and not by the user experience  i think there   s so many opportunities like that where because we are naturally curious  we   re going to go explore those spaces even if we don   t intimately know them or have experienced them i think in that sense  we actually like when we come across something that we don   t know a lot about initially  and then we have a whole research process  we bring in experts to help us  i   m actually looking for those opportunities where it   s going to be outside of my comfort zone because that   s where design could have the biggest delta or the biggest impact  of course i   m going to look for the stuff that i know already is obvious  but the non obvious things are going to be the most exciting things for us  back to the example with omada health  my grandmother and great grandmother have diabetes  so i remember seeing those needles  and just how horrible that process is  i know that my mom and others are at risk of being diabetic and that i actually was able to get her to go through the prevent program at omada  and lose ten pounds so i could see the impact that it was having in my personal life  that being said  we   re still open to finding more opportunities  whether it   s in mental health or other chronic illnesses  that just are totally preventable and with the help of technology we can accelerate prevention  i hope that in the future  we   ll be able to have more alignment with the health industry and the government to be able to even prescribe some of these digital therapeutic technologies my last question for you would be  just based on the lessons that you   ve learned  what advice would you have for young entrepreneurs or designers just getting started out in this industry one lesson is finding the right partner with complementary skills  ben and i have really complementary paths  me going through more of a stanford hci and research approach and ben coming from ucla with a formalized visual and graphic design approach  me coming from early stage startups through venture capital firms and ben coming through the rocket ship of facebook  one of the most successful tech companies of our time  another lesson is don   t underestimate the importance of finding a great opportunity  just finding a company  a brand where you can learn a ton at  make a bunch of relationships with great engineers  designers  expand your network  and get exposed to what it takes to build a great product and scale it  if you get exposure to that early on it   s going to set you up for so much more in the future i want more designers to start companies  but i don   t think that   s always the right path for a lot of people  i think by joining an existing company right before that inflection point of growth  i think there   s a lot of benefit to doing that and i think you   re going to set yourself up to be in better position if you want to start a company in the future  there   s going to be exceptions and people like joe and brian who started airbnb  they came from a very non traditional route  joe being an entrepreneur and brian working at a design consultancy  it   s totally possible to start something when you don   t look qualified  you don   t look like any of the other teams that most investors look at  that   s totally possible but i think those guys were naturally entrepreneurial  if you are going to go that path to entrepreneurship  then i think it   s so important that you find a partner  for me i found ben  using the example of joe and brian  airbnb wouldn   t be possible without their technical founder nate  it   s so important to find both a design and engineering partner in that early team  i think that   s arguably more important than anything else at those early stages  to summarize  join a successful brand while it   s on its upward trajectory and learn everything you can while you   re there  or if you are going to start something  really make sure you   re partnering with someone that you can make a long term commitment to  like ben and i have made a minimum    year commitment to our mission and to each other  if you can   t make that type of commitment to someone  then maybe reconsider whether or not you want to get married and start a company together   chuckles words from a techie turned freelance photographer  http   helenaprice coman ongoing series documenting the stories of
