original interview  http   www techiesproject com trucy phan why don   t we start at the beginning  tell me about your early years and where you come from i grew up in the midwest in a town called waterloo  iowa  i lived there my whole life and went to undergrad at the university of iowa for mechanical engineering  then moved out to california to study systems engineering at uc berkeley  where i literally knew one person  hi scott    i was only supposed to be here for   months         the length of the program         but so far i   ve been here for   years   whoops funny how that happens yeah i   m curious what it was like being a first generation american in iowa being raised by immigrant parents my parents both left vietnam in the   s and started out with almost nothing  as immigrants  they were always kind to others because they were just grateful to be here as a native iowan  i will vouch for the fact that midwesterners are very nice people naturally  when you combine that midwestern niceness with being an immigrant  you get some extra nice folks so interesting  you   re first generation college too  did you parents expect you to go to college both of my parents sacrificed so much for my brother and i to go to college that it seemed like a shame not to go  their expectations were pretty strict  both in and out of school  but any struggles i had always seemed to pale in comparison to to theirs  so what if i had homework  at least i was fortunate enough to go to school walk me through your time at berkeley  and then eventually getting into tech  did you know you would end up in tech spring of      was a pretty shitty time to graduate  regardless of most degrees  the economy was so bad that   out of   of people my age was unemployed  and i was one of them getting a job seemed like a bit of a pipe dream  so i moved in with my aunt in san jose  there wasn   t any wi fi at the house  so i would walk a mile every day to barnes and noble in the mall to look for and apply to jobs  i think i ate at every single place in the food court during that time  haha i applied to over     jobs  had a couple dozen interviews  and did a bunch of odd jobs like data entry  event promotion  and tutoring to get by  at the time  my monthly budget was      for rent  food  and everything else for a year and a half  even with two engineering degrees from well regarded universities  i didn   t receive a single job offer my lucky break came when my friend   s mom wanted a new brand for her law firm  her son connected us and i started by designing her a logo  she liked my work and we enjoyed working together so much that i ended up rebranding her website as well  based on the new logo  her site was the first i had ever designed and built  on top of that  we developed a friendship that continues to this day awesome  so walk me through the experience of getting into tech  what happened after that first website was built  and how was that experience for you while i was working on that first website  people i met at networking events or just any casual parties would ask what i was doing  so i would say    i   m working on building a website     a lot of people responded with    oh that   s cool  i know someone who needs a website    or wanted one for themselves  so i got more and more clients just by word of mouth through a friend  i found a job with a web consulting firm in san francisco  but around the same time i started working for them part time  i also received a full time job offer at lawrence berkeley national lab i worked the two jobs in parallel but my heart was really in web design and development  so i decided to quit the energy research job at lawrence berkeley and focus on what i loved doing  i remember thinking     am i crazy  it took me a year and a half to find a job  and now i   m leaving after five months     everything turned out great though  as i eventually became partner at the consulting firm and stayed for   years during that time  we built websites for governments in indonesia  angola and mongolia and worked with a bunch of city planning and transit agencies all over the us  and traveled for two months out of every year for those   years  i would say my experience with that was really great right now  i   m a product designer at a company called plate iq the product allows restaurants to dive into how much they   re spending on purchases  sort of like what mint com lets you do for personal finances  we let you know that last month you spent     of produce purchases on fancy mushrooms  or that you currently owe half a million dollars in outstanding invoices we also can automatically calculate costs for every dish on a menu  letting chefs and owners understand how each ingredient contributes to their bottom line in an industry where the margins are already so small  this kind of data is really meaningful for our customers very cool  what have been the most exciting things to you about working in product design and working in tech  what is it about the work that really excites you i love product design because i like to build bridges between what a person expects and what technology is able to offer i love that i can expect zero to   meetings in any given day  and how i can take an idea from concept to completion in sometimes just a few days  it   s a really powerful experience being able to iterate through ideas and develop them so quickly has anything in tech been on the tough side being the only woman on a team can be tough  especially if there are   other guys or something  and then there   s you  even small talk can be awkward if a guy says    i   m working from home today  the wife is sick    and doesn   t think about how that might make you  as a female  feel objectified     the wife     like     the car     if you have a name for your car  you should definitely have a name for your wife one time my friend got reported to hr by someone at work because her    hair flips were too sexy     sometimes  i   m just like  are you fucking kidding me as someone who didn   t grow up with a ton of money  what is it like seeing silicon valley and being in it for so long it   s pretty crazy sometimes  i went through a phase where i enjoyed going to all these after parties  hackathons  and conferences  every tech event had a t shirt but none were ever made for women  so i collected a bajillion poorly fitting men   s t shirts in the process  haha sometimes i feel like everyone is patting each other on the back about how good they are at helping startups help startups help other startups  and no one is doing anything meaningful that   s me being super cynical  of course  i think there are a lot of companies out here doing great work  fueled by epic rockstar developers and red bull  okay  that   s me being cynical again but seriously  startup culture can be amazing  who honestly wants to work in a real life office space  if a startup can make money and provide free meals and unlimited time off and let their employees to go vegas and hawaii for team building  that   s awesome yeah         i remember when i first worked in tech         i called it    the underbelly            the scene of everybody who spent all of their time partying and congratulating each other  verses the ones that weren   t at the parties because they were working on things that really meant something to them  it   s just a funny correlation to me  another thing that resonated with me in your pre interview was that         being raised in iowa         you were taught to be nice  and that you had to unlearn how to be nice when you moved here  which i also went through and it was really hard are you from the midwest as well i   m from north carolina where it   s like         you   re a nice southern girl and you say    hi  how are you    to everyone in the grocery stores  and i very quickly         i   m just a cold hearted human compared to the way that i was when i first got here  i   m curious to hear how it changed for you for that process sure  i actually had a friend tell me last year that i have become more condescending since he met me   years ago when i first moved here from iowa  and that absolutely sucked to hear  and i could totally see how he would feel that way  and i was glad to hear it  and i really thought about it deeply because that   s not the kind of person i want to be you also mentioned in your pre interview that going to hacker school changed your views on feminism  i   m so curious about that hacker school  now called recurse center  was one of the most inclusive working environments i have ever had the privilege of being a part of  the three months i spent in new york really changed how i felt about feminism because i had never before been part of an organization that openly said     sexism is not okay here    on top of that  the batch of recurse center i went to was     female  and it was the first time in   or   years that i was part of anything that was more than        female  if i had a question  i could ask a guy or a girl  if i sucked at something  it wasn   t because i was a girl that   s huge yeah you mentioned another thing in your pre interview about the concept of self selection  and how you   ve seen it influence hiring of people  i   m curious to hear more of your thoughts on that    culture fit    is such a big thing here  it   s hard to even coach somebody that you think is qualified for a position at a startup on how to pass the culture fit part of an interview in the bay area  i would have to know what the culture was like at every single startup and have intimate knowledge of every team at that particular startup to tell you how you need to act if you want to get hired there  chuckles   which is crazy i still can   t believe    culture fit    is a term that companies are allowed to use  it seems so obvious that that   s just a bias that is not a positive thing anymore yeah  the problem with using    culture fit    to hire is how easily it can be used to push discriminating practices under the rug  when people have these huge time and budget constraints it   s easier to go with their gut feeling instead of thinking about the real reasons they   re rejecting a candidate  i   ve seen people go the easy route and hire all their friends first  and then everyone else later     culture fit    makes it hard to get your foot in the door if you don   t know someone or have an extraordinary ability to market yourself it   s complicated because i can see myself hiring people just like me  but that   s what everybody else does too  but there aren   t many like me to start off with  so that   s a problem  because now all the non me   s are hiring people not like me it   s so complicated  you mentioned also  the importance of finding a champion at work i forgot i wrote all these things  i was like     was there all that space      laughs you wrote a lot  but it was really good  you were throwing great stuff at me yes  i was asking people for advice because i was having trouble at one of my jobs  because i felt like nobody that worked with me was my champion  that person doesn   t have to be trumpeting everything you do  but they should at least be willing to listen to you my friend suggested that no matter how good you are at something  if someone opposes you personally  you might as well leave unless you want to play office politics  honestly if you   re talented  there isn   t any reason you should have to put up with that kind of bullshit  and i mean the passive aggressive  leaving you out of important conversations  denying opportunities kind of bullshit at one point in my career  i was told    everyone is a designer these days     as if it were some trendy thing and i was just jumping on some bandwagon  as much as i respected this person for other reasons  he wasn   t qualified to be the gatekeeper of my career so after a bit of thought  i quit that job  became a designer  and haven   t regretted it since and undermines all of your talents and expertise  yes  that   s frustrating  what do you look for in a job now versus when you started  what is really important to you now when i started  i was looking for anything because i was unemployed  so i took any opportunity i could get  whether that was designing a simple  static   page website or rolling on a segway through an ice arena promoting hp photo printers now that i can afford to be picky  i look for problems i think are interesting to solve  and for people who respect me  i think being respected at work is huge and sometimes feels like a luxury  even though it shouldn   t be i also look for good listeners  i used to have a manager who would always say    i understand     but as a way of cutting you off instead of letting you know that he actually understood  i know others who say the same thing  but you can tell they actually listened because they follow up with a relevant comment or question big difference yeah i   m so curious  how do you think that your background and the culmination of your life experiences affect how you approach your work hmm  in the beginning i was just grateful for everything that was offered  i never negotiated for more money whenever i had a job just because i was just thankful  but later on i was chatting with a friend and he said he struggled with the same thing because he grew up poor as well  and he said he came to this realization that it   s not wrong to want to grow in order to reach your potential  why should anyone ever feel sorry about that i used to say i was interested in design  and i was interested in working as a designer  but most responses to that had an undertone of     oh that   s cute  you   re interested in design  too bad you   re not a real designer    it took me a long time to realize that i wasn   t hurting anyone by being honest instead of modest so now i say     i am good at what i do  i would love to work with you    my last question for you would be  what are some of the biggest lessons that you   ve learned that you would give to folks that come from similar backgrounds  what advice would you give to folks that are hoping to get into tech but may not feel like they can if you   re still in school  you have so much time to figure it all out  the technologies and tools will change by the time you graduate anyway  so just focus on learning the fundamentals and building friendships and relationships be genuine  be generous  and tactful  i have never regretted being nice to someone  rather  my most difficult friendships and relationships were often because i took someone   s generosity for granted or was nasty to the other person for no good reason be thoughtful about your decisions so when there comes a point where you thought you had your dream job and then   months in  all you want to do is quit  it   s a decision rather than a reaction  and believe me  this will happen  startups are crazy like that there   s not really one single thing that you can take to heart that will grant you success in every endeavor  but i do think it   s important to ask yourself what you want to achieve  and what is worth giving up to have that words from a techie turned freelance photographer  http   helenaprice coman
