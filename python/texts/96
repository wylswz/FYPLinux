original interview  http   www techiesproject com cassidy blackwell okay  so why don   t we start at the beginning  tell me a bit about where you come from and your early years and how you got here okay  i think i have a very interesting story  and i think what it all comes down to is that there is no single road into silicon valley  i graduated college with a degree in french literature  and growing up i had always wanted to be an architect   me  too really yeah okay  awesome  my senior year of college  i got into a master   s of architecture program at the art institute of chicago  this little  little  tiny thing inside me was like     don   t go straight into that program  defer a year     i deferred a year with the intention of moving to san francisco to save money  this is in       and i don   t know why i thought the word    san francisco    and    save money    went hand in hand  but it did for me  i guess  at the time  i had family out here  and within like the first month i realized i didn   t want to be an architect  i realized what i loved about it was theory and history as opposed to actual drafting and designing  and so i started working in pr  doing communications  web     was a thing at that time  but it just exposed me to the whole world of communications and editorial  and so i was just like     well  this feels right to me    fast forward  and i thought     i want to use these skills for something good     i was working in policy  doing criminal justice reform  accountable development  working with non profits and public agencies as a consultant  i was doing that for a couple years  and i got really bored at my job  just because i had this background  i was a french major  i wanted architecture  so i had this creative vein in everything that i do  but my work in policy wasn   t fulfilling that at that same time  i was kind of deciding to go natural  i had relaxed my hair using chemical straighteners for    years  and i decided that i didn   t want to do that anymore  i decided that it was such a big  monumental transformation that i wanted to document it and really do a lot of education about it and share it with the world  i started a website called natural selection and   such a good name  by the way thank you  i   m such an evolutionary nerd  i was really into that in college i was like  yeah  so i   m going to double entendre that  started natural selection  it just continued to grow and grow and grow  and within a few  couple years  i ended up quitting policy and pursuing my blog full time  and i was an editor for a big curly hair website  i worked with a lot of brands and traveled around the world  to the caribbean  to europe  all over atlanta just building this community of women going through the same thing that i was  and it was all just about our hair and going natural  it was really cool because i made all of these    hair friends     and    curl friends     the more that we grew our communities  the bigger the movement became  and it was a really cool moment in beauty industry history i had no intention of being in the beauty industry whatsoever  but i was  then i ended up going to work at a different startup  because i was in san francisco at the same time  and worked in a fashion startup  but then i got the itch to go back into beauty  ended up getting connected with tristan  and that was when everything really clicked  it was like     oh my gosh  here we are in san francisco in tech  doing what i love the most  which is helping people of color feel comfortable and empowered with who they actually are     a lot of it is through that surface of beauty  like the hair  the skin  et cetera  there was just this immediate synergy and shared sense of values from that perspective  and that is how i got to where i am today as you know  i have such a brand crush on your company  and i think you guys are doing the best consumer facing brand work in silicon valley  i would love to know more about the philosophy behind your work and how you approach it yeah  for me it really resonates from my hair blogging days and sort of what you asked me at the beginning of this interview  was like     tell the real story     i found when i was blogging  people really feel more connected when you   re authentic  whether it   s good  whether it   s bad  whether it   s a success  whether it   s a struggle  being able to tell those stories is what really allows people to become inspired and it   s content that really resonates with them  i think that is everything bevel taps into  how to create authentic stories from a brand perspective  and there are so many stories  and so we have so many platforms and opportunities on which we can tell them for sure  i   m curious  i touched on this with tristan  about how vcs in silicon valley only really invest in problems that they can relate to  and there   s definitely a little bubble of people not understanding products that are created for people outside of their immediate experience  despite all of these genuine stories of how your product is changing people   s lives  do you still experience skepticism outside of your company  how do you deal with that i mean  i think we have the hardest job in the world  it   s not even vcs not getting it  it   s that our target consumer is still very traumatized by a razor  because they have historically been served tools that are not designed for them  i   d say that  to me  is the area of understanding and education that we need to and are focusing on most  encouraging  enabling  and educating men of color on how to shave properly what makes me really hopeful is that was the same issue that i experienced in hair  if you had told me    years ago that i would be wearing my hair natural  i would have been like     yeah fucking right  there is no way i will ever stop straightening my hair     but i just think that just  the power of a movement and the quality of products does so much  i   m just very hopeful and confident that what we provide is going to be a real key yeah  absolutely  a big thing i   ve been focusing on in this project is people coming from diverse backgrounds and how that affects their work and how it makes them better at building products and designing products  how bringing more backgrounds to the table informs better product design  i   d love to hear more about how you guys have hired and how that has really contributed to the success of your company for me  and what we were looking for is  you just want people that can perform  what i have personally realized in my life is you don   t want people who are just going to take a job for money  i think that we have to find people with whom our values and product resonate that can also perform and  in that center of the venn diagram  is where we   ll find that core team  we   ve been really  really good at doing that  because you can really tell  somebody   s like     yeah  you just do this     and they want to apply some other things just to this  like a business model  when you find that person who actually cares  who understands  i mean  who can understand the needs regardless of ethnic background  then i think that there are lots of people out there who get it  which is really cool absolutely  what would you say are your biggest motivators  what drives you in your work i think that there are just so many cool things that we can do  cool people to talk to  cool concepts to execute  but the fact remains that  as i said  we have the challenge of being able to show people a different experience and give them a high quality design and product experience  that   s what keeps me motivated every day  it always has and i think that   s what   s gotten me to this place  from my days of blogging  showing people that there   s a better way for them  just still rings very true what do you look for in your work now versus when you started  like what do you look for in a job well  i think it kind of is a good dovetail from what i was saying before  i have made the mistake of taking an opportunity just for money  and it sucks  and you   re just working without any passion behind what you do  whereas now  holding true to the fact that i want to do things that matter to me and that resonate with me  i   ve been able to bring a lot more of myself to my work  i   m really lucky and fortunate that i get to do that  i know a lot of people don   t  and make money the number one motivator  i had an old boss who drew this         i   ve mentioned venn diagrams twice now but         he drew this triple venn diagram  and it   s like  what i   m good at  what makes me money  and what i   m passionate about  in the center is  that is where the magic happens absolutely  let   s go high level for a second in your work  in your experience working in tech  what have been some of the really proud and exciting moments for you  and what have been some of the biggest struggles that you   ve had to overcome yeah  it   s so funny  because working in    tech     quote  unquote  is such a thing that i don   t think i would ever say  i never lead tech first  i might be with somebody who   s like     oh  i work in the fashion biz  and now i   m working in the beauty biz     i think  for me  what really excites me is to pull together projects that really resonate and drive our businesses forward  which is really cool then what have been some of the biggest roadblocks or struggles that you   ve had to overcome in terms of work decades of trauma within our african american communities  and undoing that and showing that there is a different way  it   s just really hard to do  it   s not impossible  but it   s really hard to do  for men it   s this shaving situation  for women  it is the chemical products and thinking that people have to adhere to this euro centric standard  i think it   s just the hard thing to do  to show people that there is a different  better way that   s for them  and that they need to be authentic and true to themselves yeah  that   s an amazing thing  how do your friends and family feel about the work that you   ve done yeah  they   re super stoked  they always get talking points because people like to say the craziest things  now i know how to do this  i know how to control a message  because it   s my job to be able to do that  i lead the pr team at walker  so i can say     okay  this is what i do  these are the products  this is the positioning statement    and they get it  they are so excited for a while  as i was doing my blog  they were like     okay  we don   t get it     but now that they   ve been able to see how it   s evolved  and my friends are like     wow  i can   t believe        i remember   years ago  when you had your blogger website  and were kind of like     i   m going to bring back the black look with natural hair     they   re like     we just can   t believe that now you   re posting pictures of you and nas on instagram  that   s really cool     and everybody else  i just get lots of compliments and hear that they   re so excited about it the alumni director from my upper school just called me  i told her that we   re going to be in minnesota for target next week  i   m from minnesota  and she asks     can i finally meet you  this is so exciting  we   ve been watching everything that you   re doing with walker and company  and it   s so inspiring to have somebody from our community doing such a cool  unique thing    even though you don   t really consider yourself in tech  you are definitely involved in the industry  how do you feel about the state of tech in       what excites you about it  what frustrates you  what would you like to see change i   ve been in san francisco for almost    years and i   d say the thing that frustrates me most is seeing how it has shifted the greater community  that really scares me  in a way  i think that this greater region has been the most magical when there are a lot of different types of people around  for me  it   s something i   ve always drawn a lot of creative inspiration from  that there are communities and people who actually care about the city that are really present in it  as those native communities have eroded  it   s really sad  and it   s really scary to see  just because a place that you love is being infused with people who don   t necessarily love it as much or for the same reason  is just hard to stomach i feel you  i dress down when i go out of the house at all now  because i don   t want to be misconstrued for someone who is here for the wrong reasons  it   s a really weird time right  i know  you just go on a dating app  and somebody   s saying     i just moved here   weeks ago  woo hoo     and i   m like     oh  boy    my last question for you would be  based on the things that you   ve learned in your career and your time here  what advice would you give to folks from similar backgrounds who are hoping to get into this industry and just getting started i   m going to end with the same thing i started with  there   s no    one road    into tech  do what feels right to you  what your passion is about  and hopefully  and almost indefinitely  it will align  so don   t compromise who you actually are read more on http   www techiesproject com words from a techie
