by sarah friin june       fab com   s ceo  jason goldberg  dressed in all black with a red belt  arrived at the bloomberg television studios in new york  ready to spread the gospel of quirky home decor  fab sold texas shaped coffee tables  necklaces with expletive pendants  cardboard lion heads  and other unique items  and investors loved it  goldberg had raised hundreds of millions of dollars  and the latest round of venture capital valued fab at    billion  back then  a    figure valuation placed you in rare air  but goldberg wasn   t satisfied  he wanted to be bigger    there are currently four e commerce companies that are worth more than     billion dollars         amazon  rakuten in japan  alibaba in china  and ebay  and we think fab has a good chance of being the fifth one     he told bloomberg   s anchors     we have more money than we need right now to run fab well into the future    but fab did not have enough money  goldberg had raised only about half of what he needed  soon after his televised brag  bloomberg published my story about troubling cracks in the business         revenue shortfalls  a revolving door of executives  low morale         and it was even harder for goldberg to get cash from investors the turmoil that followed was well chronicled  round after round of job cuts  departures of executives  including goldberg   s co founder  and  in       the sale of what was left of the brand to an irish manufacturer  the price was     million now goldberg is back  with something new to sell  later this month he   ll launch pepo  a human resource software company  spun off from tools that were used at fab  it   s based in berlin  where goldberg now lives  and there   s an engineering team in pune  india  this time  he says on the first episode of the decrypted podcast  subscribe on itunes here   things won   t get as crazy fab   s crash is a cautionary tale for any startup that relies on selling things directly to consumers  flush with venture capital  startups use it to afford marketing or steep discounts for their customers  which help them grow         but it can   t last forever  the current startup landscape         with more than     companies valued at more than    billion         is peppered with e commerce companies yet to prove their business models  there are the subscription box companies such as birchbox  food delivery startups such as instacart and doordash  and online stores trying to have a breakout success like fab  wish  poshmark  and offerup in the larger startup landscape  enthusiasm for some of the unicorns has started to fade  some of them are taking on debt  some of them are laying off employees  goldberg is well equipped to tell those ceos what may come next  rounds of layoffs that aren   t enough  rifts between co founders  and a selloff of assets    don   t ever allow yourself to slip into thinking     we figured it out     or you risk losing it all     goldberg said     if you are ambitious and if you grow your company fast  this will be your own personal epic battle  it is very hard to remain humble when you are piloting a rocket ship  it is very hard to remain humble when the world is telling you  you are winning    if fab had been more conservative in its numbers  more careful about its rate of spending  and had not such aggressive growth goals  it might still be around today  said sucharita mulpuru  chief retail strategist at shoptalk    they might be smaller than they were  but they would be around     mulpuru said     that   s the question that every entrepreneur has to face         how do you grow quickly and still stay alive    silicon valley is a place where people like to talk about failure  posters at facebook   s headquarters urge employees to    fail fast  fail often     and books  such as one from fab investor ben horowitz     the hard thing about hard things     canonize the subject  the countless entrepreneurs on medium droning on about their shortcomings also preach that ultimately  to win big  you have to take risks  but failure isn   t always a quick stop on the way to success  sometimes it   s final    a lot of people say they   re humbled by success     goldberg said     i   ve experienced a real sort of humility from the colossal failure that was fab  i   m still working my way  personally  through it     he said he thinks often of his investors  who lost their money  and his employees  who dedicated themselves to the vision     i let them down as a leader  and that   s not fun  i feel awful for it    goldberg and his best friend  bradford shellhammer  launched fab in      and sold     million worth of merchandise in their first six months  the early problems were good ones to have  sometimes  demand outstripped supply  and a lot of manufacturers were small and inexperienced  a baker offering rainbow    unicorn poop cookies    assumed nobody would buy them but ended up selling out  fab scrambled to rent her an industrial kitchen  and employees in aprons arrived to help her bake  some presents people ordered didn   t arrive in time for christmas       so fab paid for similar things on amazon com  just so there would be something under the tree  with the original gift still en route  fab sped up shipping  but it wasn   t cheap  the company bought warehouses to prepurchase and store inventory  meanwhile  goldberg and his investors were encouraged by how enthusiastic people seemed to be about the products  so they started spending on marketing to expand more  they had a     million marketing budget in       complete with a tv commercial over the holidays  the customers flooded in  but not in the way goldberg expected  they would see an ad and make a purchase  and then never come back    we kept getting new customers  but we started to see that the profit margins were zero to negative     said howard morgan  an investor at first round capital who was on fab   s board     the only way the model made money was if people bought multiple items  if you could lose money on each customer  you   re not going to get money out of the whole  and it took us too long to understand that   s what was happening    it   s a common story among startups  especially in e commerce  said jeremy levine  a partner at bessemer venture partners  when capital is easy for a hot startup to obtain  investors are so desperate to get in on the deal that they don   t take the time to understand how much the business is spending to acquire each new customer  meanwhile  entrepreneurs often assume that as long as they can keep raising money  they can fix their business models down the line    if the math doesn   t work  eventually the capital dries up     levine said     and sometimes it dries up very quickly    since fab  there   s been a deeper focus among investors on understanding the unit economics of startup businesses         how much the company makes from every item sold  according to kirthy kalyanam  who teaches marketing at santa clara university  fab was badly positioned because it was selling a product people don   t need regularly  so it costs a lot to acquire and retain customers through marketing  couple that with how much it costs to store and ship products  as well as the capital needed to support small scale designers  and fab   s model was bad even when the business looked successful    some of these people invest thinking that the founder has some magic  that he can think about it in a way that nobody understands     kalayanam said  noting that fab had some high profile investors         andreessen horowitz  menlo ventures     why did it take so long for investors to figure it out  that   s the effect of a charismatic founder    in       goldberg was convinced that it was time to expand into europe  copycat sites had cropped up there  and he was eager to beat them while they were still small  instead of having to acquire them expensively later  he acquired one in germany and another in london  he had the london employees move to germany and visited them frequently  the chaos was mounting    we had no business doing that  in hindsight it was not just the money spent  it was the time sunk and the attention sunk     goldberg said     we should have been spending all of our time on how to get the business to a really repeatable standard process in the u s  and instead we were fighting on two fronts with half a leg and half an arm    that year  fab was trying to turn an expected     million in domestic sales into      million  in europe  it hoped to get     million  it expanded into food  pet goods  and sex toys     it resulted in a deterioration of the merchandise         the brand value  the assortment     goldberg said     and frankly  at the end of       that got kind of kitschy    anyone who would challenge goldberg   s numbers would get scolded for not believing in the vision     you can get somewhat delusional in thinking that you can just figure it out     goldberg said     you see that you   re growing  and if you can figure out a way to keep growing  you can grow your way through it    three years after fab started to unravel  goldberg has different priorities he said  he isn   t focused on being as big as amazon and alibaba  he started pepo with    million of his own money  and he   s going to be careful not to take anything for granted  he said    i   ve had people ask me  how do i know pepo is going to be successful     goldberg said     i don   t know if pepo is going to be successful  now i just think  we   re going to build a good product    this article originally appeared on bloomberg com join the thousands of others who   ve signed up to receive bloomberg technology   s newly
